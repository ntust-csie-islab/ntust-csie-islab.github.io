<a name="paper1"><h4>Supervised Fuzzy ART: a Fast Neural Network Classifier Trained via Combining Supervised and
 Unsupervised Learning</h4></a>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
A neural network model, called supervised fuzzy ART (SEART), that incorporates a supervised mechanism into a modified
fuzzy ART is presented. In any time, the training instances may or may not have desired outputs, that is, this model can handle
supervised learning and unsupervised learning simultaneously. The unsupervised component finds the cluster relations of instances,
then the supervised component learns the desired associations between clusters and classes. In addition, this model has ability of 
incremental learning. It works equally well when instances in a cluster belong to different classes. Also, multi-class and nonconvex 
classifications can also be dealt with. Moreover, the experimental results are very encouraging.

<a name="paper2"><h4>Supervised Fuzzy ART: Training of  a Neural Network for Pattern Classification via Czombining Supervised and
 Unsupervised Learning</h4></a>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
A neural network model that incorporates a supervised mechanism into a fuzzy ART is presented. In any time, the training instances
may or may not have desired outputs, that is, this model can handle supervised learning and unsupervised component finds the cluster
relations of instances, then the supervised component learns the desired associations between clusters and categories. In addition, this
model has the ability of incremental learning. It works equally well when instances in a cluster belong to different categories. This 
situation can not be handled well in unsupervised learning models, since they are unable to distinguish those instances in different 
categories with only the superficial input information. Moreover, multi-category and nonconvex classifications can also be dealt with.
