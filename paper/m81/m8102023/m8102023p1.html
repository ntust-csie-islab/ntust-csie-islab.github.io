<a name="paper1"><h4> Fuzzy Neural Network Model for Revising Imperfect Fuzzy Rules</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this thesis, a fuzzy rule-based neural network model, named KBFNN, is proposed. The initial structure of KBFNN is 
constructed by existing partial fuzzy rules. The domain theories are represented by fuzzy rules and revised by neural 
network training. To construct KBFNN by fuzzy rules, two kinds of fuzzy neurons are proposed. They are S-neurons and 
G-neurons. The S-neurons perform similarity measure to compute the firing degrees of fuzzy rules. The G-neurons carry 
out the defuzzification of inference results. For processing fuzzy number efficiently, the LR-type fuzzy numbers are 
used. An Inverted Pendulum System and a Knowledge-Based Evaluator are used to illustrate the workings of the proposed
model. However, in many problems, the initial fuzzy rules might not exist or might be hard to acquire. To deal with these 
problems, another fuzzy neural network model, called Fuzzy BP, with fuzzy inference is proposed. It performs nonlinear 
mapping between fuzzy input vectors and crisp outputs. A fuzzy neuron which performs fuzzy weighted summation, 
defuzzification, and nonlinear mapping is proposed. One sample problem, the Knowledge-Based Evaluator is considered 
to illustrate the working of Fuzzy BP, and the experimental results are very encouraging.

<a name="paper2"><h4>A Neural Network Model with Fuzzy Inference</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this paper, a neural network model, named Fuzzy BP, with fuzzy inference is proposed. It performs nonlinear mapping 
between fuzzy input vectors and crisp outputs. Therefore, it has the ability of processing fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy 
numbers are represented in LR-type to reduce network complexity. Besides, the connection weights and biases are 
represented as fuzzy numbers to increase fuzzy inference ability. In addition, a fuzzy neuron which performs fuzzy 
weighted summation, defuzzification, and nonlinear mapping is proposed. Also, a sample defuzzification formula is 
proposed. One sample problem, called Knowledge-Based Evaluator, is considered to illustrate the working of the 
proposed model, and the experimental results are very encouraging.

<a name="paper3"><h4>A Fuzzy Rule-based Neural Network Model for Revising Approximate Domain Knowledge</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this paper, a Knowledge-based Fuzzy Neural Network model, named KBFNN, is proposed. The initial structure of 
KBFNN can be constructed by approximate fuzzy rules. These approximate fuzzy rules may be incorrect or incomplete. 
Then the approximate fuzzy rules are revised by neural network learning. Also, the fuzzy rules can be extracted from a 
revised KBFNN. To construct KBFNN by fuzzy rules, two kinds of fuzzy neurons are proposed. They are S-neurons and 
G-neurons. Besides, the fuzzy number efficiently, the LR-type fuzzy numbers are used. In a sample example, a 
Knowledge-Based Evaluator (KBE) is demonstrated. The experimental results are very encouraging.
