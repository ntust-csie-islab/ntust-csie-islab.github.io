<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>

  In this thesis, a method of character preclassification for handwritten Chines
character recognition is proposed.  Since the number of Chinese
characters is very large ( at least 5401s for daily use), we employ two stages t
reduce the candidates of input character.  In stage I, we try to extract the first
primitive features from handwritten Chonese characters and use the fuzzy rules 
to create the four oreclassification groups.  The purpose in stage I is to reduce
the candidates roughly.  In stage II, we extract the second primitive features
from handwritten Chinese characters and then use the Supervised Extended
ART (SEART) as the classifier to generate the preclassification class for each
preclassification group that we creat in stage I.  The SEART classifier has
excellent performance, fast, good generalization and exceptions handling
ability in complex problem.  Since the number of character in each  
preclassification class is smaller than that in the whole character set, the
problem becomes simpler.  In order to evaluate the proposed preclassification
system, we use the 605 Chinese character categories in the text books of 
elementary school as our training and testing data.  The database used is
HCCRBASE (provided by CCL, ITRI, Taiwan).  We select the even samples
of samples 1--100 as the training set, and the odd samples of them as the
testing set.  The preclassification rate that characters of testing set can be
distributed into correct preclassification classes 98.11%.
