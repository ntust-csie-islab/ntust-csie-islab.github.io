<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
 This paper presents a multiclass neural network classifier to learn
disjunctive fuzzy information in the feature space.  This neural network
consists of two types of nodes in the hidden layer.  The prototype nodes and the
exemplar nodes represent prototypes and exemplars in the feature space,
respectively.  This classifier contains two separate training algorithms.  The
pass 1 training algorithm DYNPRO (DYNamic numbers of PROtotypes)
automatically generates and refines prototypes for distinct clusters in the
feature space.  The number and growth parameter of these prototypes are not
restricted, so the prototypes will form near-optimal decision regions to meet th
e
distribution of input patterns and classify as many input patterns as possible.
Next, the pass 2 training algorithm GFENCE (Generalized Fuzzy Exemplars
Nested Creation and Expansion) is used to place and adjust exemplars to learn
the patterns that cannot be classified by the prototypes.  Such a training
strategy can reduce the memory requirement and speed up the process of
nonlinear classification.  In addition, on-line ability is supplied in this mode
l
and the computational load is lightened.  The experimental results manifest that
the appropriate number of prototype nodes used to represent patterns clusters
can be determined by this model, and the recognition rate for disjunctive fuzzy
information evaluated by this model is encouraging.
