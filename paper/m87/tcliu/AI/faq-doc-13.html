   This is rough sometimes.  The first thing to do, of course, is to contact
   the organization that ran the conference or workshop you are interested in.
   If they can't help you, the best idea mentioned so far is to contact the
   Institute for Scientific Information, Inc. (ISI), and check with their
   Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (ISTP volumes).
