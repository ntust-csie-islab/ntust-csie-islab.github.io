<H1>[3] Where is fuzzy logic used?</H1>
<PRE>
Date: 15-APR-93

Fuzzy logic is used directly in very few applications. The Sony PalmTop
apparently uses a fuzzy logic decision tree algorithm to perform
handwritten (well, computer lightpen) Kanji character recognition.

Most applications of fuzzy logic use it as the underlying logic system
for fuzzy expert systems (see [4]).
