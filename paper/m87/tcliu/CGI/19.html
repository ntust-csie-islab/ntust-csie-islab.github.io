The most common cause of this behavior is placing the cgi 
script in a directory that the web server software does not 
recognize as one from which scripts should be run.
<p>
Most web servers have configuration options that allow the
webmaster to set up specific directories, very often something
like /cgi-bin/ where cgi scripts must reside to be recognized
as programs.
<p>
An alternative configuration is called cgi-anywhere, and uses
a file extension (such as .cgi) to indicate that a file is
a cgi script.  As this alternate method offers nearly no
security, it is seldom seen by users who have commercial
Internet Service Providers. (I disagree with this comment --
the .cgi setup can be just fine if the server is configured
to run scripts with the user ID of the user who owns them. -TB)
