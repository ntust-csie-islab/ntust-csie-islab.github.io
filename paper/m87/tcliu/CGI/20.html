It is very common to have a cgi script generate some sort of
formatted response that appears to be a regular HTML web page.
<p>
There are a couple points to keep in mind. First, HTML treats
any number of spaces as a single space and ignores conventional line returns, except inside
of the &lt;pre&gt; tag.  Second, if you are generating a file 
to which your script directs the user's browser, you may want
to write out line feeds and HTML line breaks to make the HTML 
more easily readable in the source browser.
<p>
A popular way to write large blocks of HTML in Perl cgi scripts
is to use HERE documents.  This encloses a large segment of 
information as if it were a single string, saving the typing of
a great many quotes!
