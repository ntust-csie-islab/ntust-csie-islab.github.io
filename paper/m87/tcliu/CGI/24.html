		<P>If you do not have root access, you will need to install
these modules in an alternate location. If you were
installing these tools as root, you would do it like this:

<PRE>
       perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
</PRE>


To do this in an alternate location, first create
the directory you will use instead. If that directory
is called <code>/path_to_your_home/lib/perl5</code>, then you
install the tools like this:

<pre>
       perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path_to_your_home \
        INSTALLPRIVLIB=/path_to_your_home/lib/perl5 \
        INSTALLSCRIPT=/path_to_your_home/bin \
        INSTALLSITELIB=/path_to_your_home/lib/perl5/site_perl \
        INSTALLBIN=/path_to_your_home/bin \ 
        INSTALLMAN1DIR=/path_to_your_home/man  \
        INSTALLMAN3DIR=/path_to_your_home/man3
        make
        make test
        make install

        (in some cases perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path_to_your_home would be sufficient)
 
</PRE>

<BR>
Then, each time you want to use modules in that path, you should add this to your
scripts as the second line:</P>

<pre>
use lib qw(/path_to_your_home/lib/perl5 /path_to_your_home/lib/perl5/site_perl);
</pre>
This line instructs Perl 5 to look for libraries in that
directory as well as the standard directories.
<p>
Also consider using the wonderful CPAN.pm module to install and upgrade
the perl modules available at CPAN (see <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">www.perl.com/CPAN</A>).
If you have perl5.004 or higher you have it bundled with your distribution.
Otherwise, download it from CPAN. When you install it the first time, it asks
you a few questions; one of them is a PREFIX directory name as above. After configuration
is over, you run it like so:
<pre>

% perl -MCPAN -e shell
&gt; install CGI
</pre>
This will fetch the latest CGI module, unpack it, make it, test it and
install it into your local area or any other directory you instruct it to!</P>
<p>
More CPAN.pm tricks:
<p>
<pre>
&gt; i /CGI/
</pre>
Returns the list of modules that match that pattern. Many
other functions are also available.
