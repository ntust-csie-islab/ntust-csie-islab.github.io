<P>CGI, or &quot;Common Gateway Interface&quot;, is a specification which allows World Wide Web users to run programs on your computer. CGI isn't a programming language in itself; rather, it is a gateway which allows programs or scripts written in other languages to be run over the Internet.</P>

<P>CGI programs usually take input passed to it from a form on a web page, process the information somehow, and then format the results in HTML. The result is a web page that is generated on-the-fly.</P>

<P>The language of choice for CGI processing is <A HREF="http://www.perl.com" TITLE="Perl Web Page">Perl</A>, or &quot;Practical Extraction and Reporting Language&quot;. Perl is used often because it is specifically designed to butcher multiple text files and format them nicely, making it exceptional for writing HTML.</P>

<P>Other languages used occasionally for CGI Scripts are (in descending order of popularity) C/C++, Visual Basic, AppleScript, UNIX Shell, and Tcl.</P>

<P>CGI Scripts can do almost anything when they are cleverly written.  Scripts exist which <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com" TITLE="Yahoo!">run search engines</A>, <A HREF="http://www.everychat.ml.org/" TITLE="EveryChat">manage chat rooms</A>, and even <A HREF="http://telegarden.aec.at/" TITLE="The Telegarden">control robotic arms remotely</A>. As a matter of fact, this FAQ is also maintained through extensive use of Perl CGI scripts (Good job, by the way, Tom!).</P>

<P>Several resources already exist to get you into CGI programming. One of my favorite places to start when I need inspiration is <A HREF="http://www.cgi-resources.com" TITLE="The CGI Resource Index">The CGI Resource Index</A>, which has hundreds of scripts already written.  You can look at the source code to see how the scripts are written.</P>

<P>If you want to write your own CGI programs in Perl, get a copy of either <A HREF="http://cgi-lib.stanford.edu/cgi-lib/" TITLE="The cgi-lib Home Page">
cgi-lib.pl</A> (my personal preference) or <A HREF="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html" TITLE="CGI.pm - a Perl5 CGI Library">CGI.pm</A>. These libraries automate the process of getting form input from a web page through CGI. They also provided a limited set of routines to begin building the framework of a resulting web page.</P>

<P>Of course, if you are in need of programming help, the CGI Programming OpenFAQ is always available! ;)</P>
