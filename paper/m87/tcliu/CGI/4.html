	CGI scripts are a very powerful facility,
with some risks attached to them. In a Unix system, if CGI scripts run 
with the same user ID as the web server itself, poorly or
maliciously written scripts can damage files or open security holes.
<P>
There are two important steps that should be taken to correct this:
<P>
1. NEVER run your web server as root; make sure it
is configured to change to another user ID at startup time. (This is
standard practice in all web server distributions, but 
administrators have been known to change it back to running
as root anyway. Don't.)
<P>
2. Consider using a wrapper such as

<a HREF="ftp://ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/net/www/tools/cgi-src/">
user.c</a>
<URL:ftp://ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/net/www/tools/cgi-src/> ,
or <a HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~cgiwrap">CGIwrap</a>
<URL:http://www.umr.edu/~cgiwrap> or the
module for this purpose that comes with the Apache server
to ensure that each CGI script runs with the permissions and user ID of the
user responsible for it. 
<P>
3. Consider routinely scheduled back-ups if data preservation
is important to you.
<P>
4. Consider routinely scheduled monitoring or automatic
monitoring of service and data if it is important that
the data and service be available at all time.
<P>
5. Consider intrusion and destructive behavior detection
systems, remote logging service for identification, and
a good lawyer if web security is important to you or you
have the resources to spend on enforcing security other
than dealing with the potential headaches.
<P>
6. Consider hiring security experts or at least plan to test
internally your web applications, test your web server, and
test other network services for even better security.
<P>
7. Consider security issues in your requirements analysis,
specification, design, implementation, and testing phases
when developing web applications.
<P>
If proper precautions are taken, user CGI scripts can be 
reasonably safe. As always, dumb mistakes that open security
holes for outsiders are more likely to be the cause of
problems than actual malice on the part of your own users.
