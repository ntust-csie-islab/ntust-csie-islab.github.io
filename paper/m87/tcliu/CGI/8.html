		<h4>The Server Must Recognize Your Program</h4>
Simply linking from your page to an executable program
or script won't cause it to be run by the server. There are
two common arrangements: either files in 
directories specially designated by the
server administrator are executed as CGI scripts,
or files with a special extension (such as .cgi)
are executed as CGI scripts. 
<P>
These are just two possible ways your server might
be configured. Many sites don't allow users to
run CGI scripts at all. Consult your
web server's administrator.
<h4>Always Output a MIME Type</h4>
Every CGI script must output a MIME type
indicating what kind of document it is producing. If your script 
outputs an HTML page, the correct format is:
<P>
<code>Content-type: text/html</code>
<P>
Followed by two line feeds (ascii 10 decimal).
<P>
After the MIME type, output the desired HTML.
<h4>Always Flush Output</h4>
On many systems, unexpected problems can result when
a CGI script outputs a MIME type, then executes another
program to generate output. To prevent such problems,
flush standard output before executing other programs.
If your script is written in C, the proper code
is usually: <code>fflush(stdout); </code>
<h4>Permissions and Paths: Why Can't My Script Access My Files?</h4>
CGI programs typically execute with a current directory and
user ID that differ from your personal home directory and
user ID. When you write CGI programs, make sure any files
accessed are accessed by absolute path (beginning from the
root of the file system). Also, users of multiuser systems
such as Unix may have to grant all users read access or even write access 
to data files using the chmod command. This is not an ideal
situation. Better servers run your CGI programs using your user ID.
Talk to your admin if you have difficulties in this area.
<h4>When One Browser Works and Another Doesn't</h4>
Some browsers are tolerant of incorrect Content-type
headers, as well as of null characters in text/html
or text/plain output. Make sure your output is strictly
correct; it helps to check the script with several
different browsers.


<h4>Obtaining Complete Error Messages From CGI Programs</h4>
Programmers in all languages can often obtain any messages
that were written to "standard error" by examining the
error log of the web server. The error log is typically in
the same directory with the main web server log file.
<p>
Perl programmers wanting to know what the actual error
was in detail when a CGI program fails can add the following
code to their programs.
<blockquote>
I have just learned a nice snippet to use for CGI&nbsp;debugging, put
at the beginning of your code or even better in BEGIN{} block then any
time your script calls die() or warn() All the STDERR&nbsp;will be printed
to your browser's window. So from now on no need to use error logs , almost
:-)
</blockquote>

<PRE>  
          ## death handler, presumes no output yet
          $SIG{``__DIE__''} = $SIG{``__WARN__''} = sub {
            my $error = shift;
            chomp $error;
            $error =~ s/[<&>]/``&#''.ord($&).``;''/ge;  # entity escape;
            print ``Content-type: text/html\n\n[$error]\n'';
            exit 0;
          };
           </PRE>

<P>Example: <BR>
open FILE, $file or die &quot;Can't open $file:$!\n&quot;;</P>

<P>If the open call fails, you will see the message you passed
to die() in your browsers's window.</P>
