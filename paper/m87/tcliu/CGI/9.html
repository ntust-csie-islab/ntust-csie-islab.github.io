	There are two ways:
<h3>Using a mailto: URL</h3>
You can simply create a link which looks like this:
<P>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:me@my.address">Send Me Mail&lt;/A>
<P>
This works great for browsers that support the mailto: URL. Perhaps
Perhaps 95% of web users will be able to use such a link. 
A few older browsers do not support it, but giving out an
email address is often a reasonable backup.
<h3>Installing a comment form</h3>
If you have access to the server's configuration files, or if your
server administrator permits users to create their own CGI scripts,
you can create a form which sends mail to you from any browser
that supports forms. A really flexible package for this
is the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/cgiemail/">
mit-dcns-cgi package</A> (URL is &lt;URL:http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/cgiemail/&gt; ). I've written a simple 
<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/email/">email forms package
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.boutell.com/email/&gt; )</A>,
which does it in ANSI C. Many other such packages exist.
<p>
<A HREF="http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hoagland/">
GetComments</A> (URL is &lt;URL:http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hoagland/&gt;) 
is a more general package, written in Perl, which can
do many different things in response to a form submission.
<p>
<a href="http://www.mornini.com/">InfoMania</a> offers a tool
called Uniform which automatically formats e-mail based on the
input received from a form posting. This "one size fits all"
CGI program is a convenient alternative to writing custom
CGI programs. &lt;URL:http://www.mornini.com/&gt;
<p>
<a href=http://www.note.com/success/public/freeform/?openfaq>FreeForm</a>
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.note.com/success/public/freeform/?openfaq&gt;)
is a service which is provided to web content publishers, allowing them to add
free fill-out forms to their site.  They can get feedback from their site's visitors,
without needing to access CGI on their provider's server, or to even know CGI.
