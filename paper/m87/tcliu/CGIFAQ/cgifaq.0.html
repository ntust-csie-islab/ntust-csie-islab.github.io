The WebThing software permits collaborative authoring using your web
browser. When you are reading any entry in this InterFAQ, you can add a
new entry which will then appear as another "more on" subject.
<a href="http://www3.pair.com/webthing/">http://www3.pair.com/webthing/</a>
(note: the version at this site is no longer listed in the previous question)

In order to maintain the quality of the FAQ, and avoid inappropriate
'commercial' entries, write permission is limited using an Access Control
List. If you have a contribution to make, send me an email including your
WebThing userid (i.e. what you entered in the registration form) and I'll
add you to the list.

InterFAQ readers - If your browser isn't showing a "new entry" button, then
either you aren't logged in or you're not on the access control list.

Note that this InterFAQ is limited to questions-and-answers appropriate to
periodic Usenet posting. Other types of contribution can be added
elsewhere in the WebCentre. For example

    * If you have a relevant website and want to link to it, enter it the
      appropriate collection (e.g. "scripts" or "misc").    You can then
      also include a description of your site, and have it indexed.
    * If you want to post a question or comment on something in this
      document, you can post it as a followup to the "flat" version of the
      FAQ (library document in the "FAQS" collection). 

If you don't want to use the InterFAQ you can always mail me
( <a href="mailto:nick@webthing.com">mailto:nick@webthing.com</a> )

Please don't.  Post them to an appropriate newsgroup, where they'll
be seen and possibly answered by a whole lot more people than just me.
And remember: bad (or incoherent) questions get bad answers, so think
carefully before posting.

If you have an actual programming job to do, I might be interested
However, I am currently not interested in jobs below $1000 under
any circumstances.

If you think something already in the FAQ needs clarifying, feel free
to mail me: don't expect a personal reply, but I *might* add
something to the answer in question, so check the next posting (or three).

This is now a moderated newsgroup.   The moderator is a bot run by
Thomas Boutell ( <a href="mailto:boutell@boutell.com">mailto:boutell@boutell.com</a> ).   The charter for
moderation is as follows:

  This newsgroup is self-moderated.  Your first posting will not appear
  until you have read and responded to an automatic welcome mailing, at
  which point your posting will appear with no further delay.  Provision
  will also be made to automatically approve first postings that contain
  a header requesting this.  Subsequent postings are approved
  automatically.

If posting normally doesn't work - as could be the case if your
newsfeed has trouble with moderated groups - you can post articles
by emailing them to:
	<a href="mailto:authoring-cgi@boutell.com">mailto:authoring-cgi@boutell.com</a>
Provided the return address in your mail is correct, you will then
receive precise instructions for having your post(s) automatically approved.

Alternative means of posting are detailed in the WWW FAQ, posted
regularly by Thomas Boutell.
