This FAQ attempts to deal with mSQL. Because of time and space
constraints, other applications, including value added applications
provided with the mSQL distribution such as W3-mSQL and Lite, will not
be covered in any great detail. <p>
 
<a href="#other-apps">Third party applications</a> mentioned in this
FAQ may not be compatible with the current release of mSQL - by
necessity their development will lag that of mSQL. If you have any
questions concerning their status please contact the

application in question. <p>

<h3><a name="what-is-sql">What is SQL?</a></h3>
 
The following section is based on chapter 1 of &quot;Oracle7 Server -
SQL Language Reference Manual&quot; - Oracle Corporation, December
1992, part number 778-70-1292. <p>
 
<b>SQL</b> is an acronym that stands for <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery
<b>L</b>anguage. It is often pronounced &quot;<i>sequel</i>&quot;. It
was developed in the mid 1970s by IBM. <p>
 
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International
Standards Organisation (ISO) have adopted SQL as the standard language
for relational database management systems. <p>
 
SQL provides commands for a variety of tasks including: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> querying data
    <li> inserting, updating and deleting rows in a table
    <li> creating, replacing, altering and dropping objects
    <li> controlling access to the database and its objects
    <li> guaranteeing database consistency and integrity
</ul>
 
SQL provides easy to learn commands that are both consistent and
applicable for all users. <p>
 
While most relational database management systems - including mSQL -
provide support for SQL, each vendor usually has their own unique
extensions to the language that may hinder the portability of SQL
procedures from one database platform to another. <p>

<h3><a name="what-is-msql">What is mSQL?</a></h3>
 
mSQL is mini SQL, a light weight database engine developed by
<a href="http://Bond.edu.au/Bond/Admin/ITS/People/bambi">
David J. Hughes</a>
<a href="mailto:bambi@hughes.com.au">&lt;bambi@hughes.com.au&gt;</a> at
<a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a>, Australia. It has
been designed to provide fast access to stored data with low memory
requirements. As its name implies mSQL offers a subset of SQL as its
query interface. Although it only supports a subset of SQL, everything
it supports is in accordance with the ANSI SQL specification. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="platforms">What platforms will it run on?</a></h3>
 
mSQL has been developed under Sun OS 4.1.1 but has been tested under
Solaris 2.<i>x</i> (release 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5), Ultrix 4.3, Linux, and
OSF/1 (cc not gcc). That said, it should &quot;<tt>autoconf</tt>&quot;
and build on most BSD derived systems, SVR4 based systems or POSIX
O/S's (that should cover most of them). It has been reported that it
works out-of-the-box on HP-UX, NeXT, SCO, Sequent, Cray, Tandem, *BSD
and a few others. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="shareware">Is it free?</a></h3>
 
David Hughes writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    &quot;mSQL has been released in the past under terms known as
    'conscience-ware', the basic concept of which was that companies
    that used the software could contribute a small amount to the
    continued development of the software without any strict rules
    being placed upon such 'donations'. Although the concept sounds
    fair, it failed badly with only 3 contributions being made from
    over 3,600 copies of mSQL-1.0.5 that were ftp'ed from my machine
    alone. Over 1,000 of those copies went to commercial organisations
    and I receive many questions a day from companies using mSQL behind
    their WWW servers etc who are looking for free support. <p>
 
    In an attempt to balance this out and allow me to devote some time
    to mSQL (rather than other pursuits that I do to generate an
    income), mSQL is now shareware. I still believe in free software
    over the Internet and cooperation in research so the new license is
    designed not to hurt Universities, research groups and other people
    that _should_ have free access to software. Commercial
    organisations that are using this so that they don't have to buy an
    Oracle or an Ingres will now have to buy mSQL (at a minute fraction
    of the cost of one of the commercial offerings). <p>
 
    Please read the doc/License file to see if you are required to
    register your copy. An invoice is included in both Postscript and
    ASCII format to ease the generation of payments.&quot;
</pre>
 
You may freely use mSQL if and only if you fall into the categories
outlined in the mSQL License file: <p>
 
<pre>
    You can use this software free of charge if you are an educational
    institution (excluding commercial training organisations),
    non-commercial research organisation, registered charity,
    registered not-for-profit organisation, or full-time student.
</pre>
 
If you do not fall into any of these categories, you will have to pay
a license fee to use mSQL. As of release 1.0.16, the cost of mSQL is:
<p>
 
<pre>
    Commercial Installation - AUD $225
 
    Private Installation - AUD $65
</pre>
 
Exchange rates may vary wildly, but at the time of preparing this FAQ,
the Australian dollar was trading at about 0.75 US dollars. This
information is provided as an indication only. You MUST check your
local exchange rates before preparing to purchase mSQL. <p>

There are no official patches to any release of mSQL. If modifications

The above not withstanding there is one unofficial patch that should
be applied to mSQL version 1.0.16. <p>

    After sitting here banging my head against the old &quot;missing table&quot;
    bug with my partner in crime Jason <a href="mailto:jason@fan.net.au"> &lt;jason@fan.net.au&gt;</a> , we've fixed
    it !!!!!  This is yet another very obscure bug.  So, can it be
    reproduced?  Yup, once you know the problem.
 
	o Fill the table cache
	o Cause a reference to a table that doesn't exist
	o The oldest cache entry will have the table definition list
	  set to NULL but with the name, DB, and age fields still set
 
    We all owe a debt of thanks to Jason as it was his inability to type
    table names correctly that found the problem :)

<h3><a name="known-bugs">Are there any known bugs or problems with the
current release of mSQL?</a></h3>
 
Since the release of mSQL 1.0.12, several problems have been reported
to the <a href="#mailing-list">mSQL mailing list</a>. These are outlined
below. <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> <b>Problems with table/field name lengths</b> <p>
 
    The definition of
    <tt><b><a href="#table-limits">NAME_LEN</a></b></tt> changed from
    version 1.0.10 to 1.0.12. It now seems that 18 characters is the
    maximum value for a table or field name. This problem exists in
    mSQL versions 1.0.12 and above. <p>
 
    David Hughes writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    The reason it changed in 1.0.12 is because I had a couple of
    field_name buffers that didn't have room for a trailing NULL. Now,
    trying to fix that without altering the size of the struct implies
    that you have to shorten the name of the field (to leave the
    required room). I didn't want to force everyone out there to drop
    and reload every database they have just because of a 1 byte buffer
    over-run.
 
    If this is a major problem for you then ....
 
	o dump all your databases
	o find the definition in question
	o set it to a value you like
	o rebuild everything
	o reload everything
 
    If you can work out what to change to get the extra field name
    length then you know enough about what you are doing to do the rest
    of what's required. I haven't provided a step-by-step because if
    people can't find the value they have to change I'm sure they'd
    still end up asking the list about this stuff after breaking
    things.
</pre>
 
    At present there is NO patch to fix this problem. Possible
    workarounds are David's method outlined above or to downgrade to
    version 1.0.10. <p>
 
    <li> The regular expression code in version 1.0.14 and above has
    been cleaned up with the unfortunate side affect of making it
    impossible to search for the special characters <tt>^</tt> and
    <tt>\</tt>.  <p>
 
    The cleanup also changes the way in which other special characters
    can be searched. The tables in the section
    <a href="#escape-chars">&quot;What other characters need
    special treatment?&quot;</a> outline the differences for versions
    up to and including version 1.0.13 and 1.0.14 and above. <p>
 
    <li> There are still isolated reports of <tt>msqld</tt> crashing
    with SIGSEGV (segmentation violation) errors under Linux. These
    occurrences have diminished but have not disappeared. There has
    been one report that the problem lies not within mSQL or Linux but
    in the hardware in use. An upgrade of the hardware may eliminate
    the SIGSEGV conditions. For more non mSQL specific details on this
    problem see: <p>
 
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11">http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11</a>
</pre>
 
    <li> Some users have reported the <tt>msqld</tt> consumes large
    amounts of memory when doing ORDERed selects: <p>
 
    Marty Picco writes:
 
<pre>
    I have a 200K+ record database running on a p90 with 96MB memory.
    I have noticed that the first SELECT I do on this database after
    msqld is started causes msqld to grab as much memory as it can...in
    this case about 68MB. It appears that the memory is never released
    until the daemon is restarted. Indeed, the SELECT does have an
    ORDER clause.
</pre>
 
    David has said that he'll investigate this problem. <p>
 
    <li> There are still isolated reports of mSQL behaving strangely
    under HP-UX 9.<i>x</i>. Any strangeness is more than likely a
    symptom of a broken <tt>mmap()</tt> implementation. Try
    compiling mSQL without <tt>mmap()</tt> support by editing <p>
 
<pre>
    ./targets/<i>your-architecture</i>/site.mm
</pre>
 
    and ensuring the <tt>mmap()</tt> directive reads: <p>
 
<pre>
    MMAP=
</pre>
 
    and then compile and re-install the mSQL package.
 
</ul>

<h3><a name="version2">What are the current problems with mSQL
2.0B<i>x</i>?</a></h3>
 
<b>Note:</b> This section is temporary. It will be merged into the
rest of the FAQ as mSQL 2.<i>x</i> matures. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> Some parts of this section have been compiled by Lloyd
Parkes <a href="mailto:Lloyd.Parkes@vuw.ac.nz">
&lt;Lloyd.Parkes@vuw.ac.nz&gt;</a>. <p>
 
There are a few known problems with the current release of mSQL
2.0B<i>x</i>. This list is undoubtedly incomplete and will probably
remain so because of the &quot;moving target&quot; nature of new
software. <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> mSQL 2.<i>x</i> requires a fully functioning <tt>mmap()</tt>.
    If your operating system does not support <tt>mmap()</tt> then you
    can't use mSQL 2.<i>x</i>. The following operating systems are
    known to provide insufficient <tt>mmap()</tt> support: <p>
 
	<ul>
	    <li> NeXT <p>
 
	    <li> Linux - kernel 1.2.<i>x</i> and below. (Linux
	    1.3.<i>x</i> and above should be fine). <p>
 
	    <li> A/UX 3.1.1 <p>
 
	    <li> DEC Ultrix <p>
 
	    <li> MachTen <p>
 
	    <li> UNICOS (Cray research)
	</ul>
	<p>
 
    <li> There are some new keywords which cannot be used as table or
    field names. See the table in the section <a href="#reserved-words">
    &quot;Can I use mSQL reserved words as field or table
    names?&quot;</a> below. <p>
 
    <li> The internal format of the database files has changed
    significantly. If you wish to use mSQL 1.<i>x</i> databases with
    mSQL 2.<i>x</i> you must reload them. The following procedure
    should be followed: <p>
 
    <ol>
	<li> Using mSQL 1.<i>x</i>, dump your database with
	<tt>msqldump</tt>: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqldump -h <i>dbhost</i> -c <i>dbname</i> &gt; db.dump
</pre>
 
	<li> Edit <tt>db.dump</tt> and change ALL occurrences of
	<tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt> definitions to <tt>INDEX</tt>. <p>
 
	<li> Edit <tt>db.dump</tt> and change ALL occurrences of mSQL
	keywords used as table or fields names. <p>
 
	<li> Using mSQL 2.<i>x</i>, reload your database with
	<tt>msql</tt>: <p>
 
<pre>
    msql -h <i>dbhost</i> <i>dbname</i> &lt; db.dump
</pre>
 
    </ol>
 
    <li> The mSQL 2.<i>x</i> API has some new functionality. You MUST
    re-link all your third party applications with the new API. This
    should be generally successful as the new API is a superset of the
    mSQL 1.<i>x</i> API. <p>
 
    <b>Note:</b> Simply relinking will NOT make the new functionality
    available - the third party application must take advantage of the
    new functions for you to make use of them. Relinking will only
    enable you to use your existing third party applications with the
    mSQL 2.<i>x</i> database server. <p>
 
    <li> mSQL 2.<i>x</i> uses a different protocol than version
    1.<i>x</i>. The tools provided with mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>, such
    as <tt>msql</tt>, <tt>msqladmin</tt>, <tt>relshow</tt>, etc will
    not work with mSQL version 2.<i>x</i>. You MUST use the tools
    provided with the version 2.<i>x</i> distribution. <p>
 
    <li> You cannot perform regular expression searches on
    <tt>TEXT</tt> fields. <p>
 
    David Hughes writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    TEXT fields will always be slower than CHAR fields because the data
    is split over multiple buffers. As for the searching you can do
    anything other than *LIKE testing at the moment. I'll try to work
    out a way to do LIKE and CLIKE on TEXT fields. RLIKE is a
    non-option.
</pre>
 
    <li> mSQL 2.0B5 uses a different database format than previous
    2.<i>x</i> releases. This change was made to accommodate 64 bit
    aligned data for machines running 64 pit processors such as the
    DEC Alpha. If you are upgrading from a previous 2.<i>x</i> release
    to 2.0B5 or beyond, you must dump your databases and reload them
    using the following procedure: <p>
 
	<ol>
	    <li> Use <tt>msqldump</tt> from the mSQL version
	    2.<i>x</i> release you are currently using to dump your
	    databases: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqldump -h <i>dbhost</i> -c <i>dbname</i> &gt; db.dump
</pre>
 
	    <li> Drop the old database using <tt>msqladmin</tt> from
	    the mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> release you are currently using
	    to dump your databases: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqladmin drop <i>dbname</i>
</pre>
 
	    <li> Remove the old version of mSQL 2.<i>x</i> and install
	    the new version which should be mSQL version 2.0B5 or
	    above. <p>
 
	    <li> Create the new database using <tt>msqladmin</tt> from
	    mSQL version 2.0B5: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqladmin create <i>dbname</i>
</pre>
 
	    <li> Use the <tt>msql</tt> monitor from mSQL 2.0B5 to
	    reload the dumped data: <p>
 
<pre>
    msql -h <i>dbhost</i> <i>dbname</i> &lt; db.dump
</pre>
 
    </ol>
 
    <li> <tt>msqlimport</tt> has a number of problems. <p>
 
    <ul>
	<li> Empty fields in the input are not parsed as NULL fields,
	or anything else for that matter.
 
	<li> There seems to be a problem with memory being trashed.
 
	<li> Lossage when a delimiter longer than one character is
	specified.
 
    </ul>

    A patch is available from <a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~lloyd/msql">
    http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~lloyd/msql</a>. <p>
 
    <li> <tt>msqldump</tt> has trouble dumping the new <tt>DATE</tt>
    type fields. It doesn't surround them with single quotes. This
    patch from Andreas Wadephul
    <a href="mailto:wadib@uhura.asfh-berlin.de">

    <li> Heikki Vatiainen <a href="mailto:hessu@cs.tut.fi">
    &lt;hessu@cs.tut.fi&gt;</a> has found a problem where the server
    (or client?) gets very confused with <tt>INSERT</tt> queries that
    have large amounts of data. <p>
 
    More details are available from
    <a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~lloyd/msql">

    <li> Eric Huss <a href="mailto:e-huss@uiuc.edu">
    &lt;e-huss@uiuc.edu&gt;</a> reports there seems to be some
    inconsistencies in the behaviour of the mSQL API calls
    <tt>msqlListFields()</tt> and <tt>msqlListIndex()</tt>.  When
    passing a table name to <tt>msqlListFields()</tt>, if there is a
    newline character at the end of the table name, there is no
    problem. However, when passing a table name to
    <tt>msqlListIndex()</tt>, and the table name has a newline
    character at the end, then it doesn't work. This is due to the fact
    that msql is using <tt>strok(NULL,"\n\r")</tt> to chop up the
    arguments, and the extra newline in the middle causes problems. <p>
 
    <li> Brendan Quinn <a href="mailto:brendan@nexus.sofcom.com.au">

    If you have a field that is full and you do a like/clike search
    where the last character of the like string matches the last
    character of the field, mSQL-2.0 b3 and 4 (at least) incorrectly
    match.
 
    Example
    -------
 
    mSQL &gt; create table blah ( Organisation CHAR(50) ) \g
    Query OK.  1 row(s) modified or retrieved.
    mSQL &gt; insert into blah Values ('1995 Hopman Cup Tennis Tournament, Perth
    Western A') \g
    Query OK.  1 row(s) modified or retrieved.
    mSQL &gt; select * from blah where Organisation clike '%abababa%' \g
    Query OK.  1 row(s) modified or retrieved.
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    | Organisation                                       |
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    | 1995 Hopman Cup Tennis Tournament, Perth Western A |
    +----------------------------------------------------+
 
    which of course is wrong.

    LIKE &amp; CLIKE
	fixed problems with non-null terminated data.
	fixed problems with _ handling.
	fixed one other glitch that I don't have a good name for.
	While my initial versions ran slightly slower than the original,
	some recent optimisations seem to make this version very close
	or better (especially for expressions with multiple %'s).
 
    RLIKE
	fixed problems with non-null terminated data.
	added a larger expression cache that is a win for queries with
	multiple RLIKE's or applications that repeatedly use the same
	expressions.  The cache size can be changed for installations
	that would run better with a different size.  See the code comments.
 
    SLIKE
	fixed problems with non-null terminated data.
 
    General row matching:
	fixed glitch in charMatch that would execute both the regular
	and *LIKE code for the NOT *LIKE operators.
	fixed glitches in rowMatch where the type checking could let
	some of the *LIKE operators be applied to non-character types.

This FAQ only details those

necessary for the general operation of mSQL. There are a number of
other user contributed patches that enhance the operation of mSQL.
Some of these patches are available via anonymous ftp while others are
available from the mSQL mailing list

Some of these patches are for older releases of mSQL. They may have
been rolled into subsequent releases of mSQL or they may not work with
later releases of mSQL or they may break the successful operation of

    former glory - that is you can now search for the characters
    <tt>\</tt> and <tt>^</tt>. <p>
 
    Robert writes:
 
<pre>
    1.  Adjusted the deletion of backslashes during the mSQL to regexp
	translator code to make treatment of special characters more
	uniform. In other words, all regexp special characters except
	backslash require only two backslashes in front of them to be
	treated normally. (One is stripped by msql or the translator;
	the second by the regexp package.) The backslash character
	requires four backslashes because it is the escape character
	for both the msql monitor and the regexp package. The single
	quote, of course, remains the same needing only one backslash
	because it is special only to mSQL.
 
	So, you can all now search for \ and ^ and everything else. Or
	so my ever expanding test set tells me.
 
    2.  The execution of some of the non-LIKE comparison code by the
	NOT LIKE operator is fixed. (This should probably be a
	miniscule performance increase--except that it might be eaten
	by 1.)

    I just want to share this little patch which solve the mmap problem
    for NeXTSTEP. It apparently works (meaning all msql tests are OK)
    for:
 
	NSFIP 3.3 p1
	NS Motorola 3.3 p1.
	It does NOT work for HP 3.2
 
    All other configurations are untested !

<h3><a name="how-to-patch">How do I apply patches to the mSQL
source?</a></h3>
 
Patches are distributed as context based difference listings. That is
the line by line differences between the original file and the new file
are listed with surrounding lines of code to provide some context
information. They are usually <a href="#contrib-patches">generated</a>
by using a program such as <tt>diff</tt>. <p>
 
The easiest way to apply these patches is to use Larry Wall's
<tt>patch</tt> program: <p>
 
<pre>
    <i>Patch</i> will take a patch file containing any of the four forms of
    difference listing produced by the <i>diff</i> program and apply those
    differences to an original file, producing a patched version. By
    default, the patched version is put in place of the original, with
    the original file backed up to the same name with the extension
    &quot;.orig&quot;.
</pre>
 
<tt>Patch</tt> is available from a number of anonymous ftp sites
worldwide. Latest versions of <tt>patch</tt> are being distributed by
the Free Software Foundation as part of the GNU suite of products. <p>
 
If you're having difficulty finding the latest version of
<tt>patch</tt>, you can download version 2.1 via anonymous ftp from:
 
<pre>
    <a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Misc/patch-2.1.tar.gz">ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Misc/patch-2.1.tar.gz</a>
    (74856 bytes)
</pre>
 
While some patches are fairly simple - often involving minor changes
to a single line of code - others are quite complex and attempting to
apply these patches by hand is definitely NOT recommended. Use the
<tt>patch</tt> program whenever you need to apply a patch. <p>
 
To apply the <a href="#recommended-patches">patches listed in this
FAQ</a>, use this procedure:
 
<ol>
    <li> Save the patch to a file - say <tt>/tmp/msql-patch1</tt>.
    Only save the patch information - the <tt>patch</tt> program can
    usually determine which parts of the file are patches and which
    parts are not but its easier for you to strip out any unnecessary
    information before running <tt>patch</tt>. <p>
 
    You should be left with a file containing a number of sections
    similar to: <p>
 
<pre>
*** ./src/msql/net.c.orig	Tue Oct 17 11:24:03 1995
--- ./src/msql/net.c	Tue Dec 12 15:24:11 1995
***************
*** 66,72 ****
 
 
 
! void writePkt(fd)
	int	fd;
  {
	u_char	*cp;
--- 66,72 ----
 
 
 
! int writePkt(fd)
	int	fd;
  {
	u_char	*cp;
</pre>
 
    <li> Change directories to your mSQL source repository. For
    example: <p>
 
<pre>
    cd /usr/local/src/db/Minerva/msql/msql-1.0.16
</pre>
 
    <li> Apply the patch as follows: <p>
 
<pre>
    patch -l &lt; /tmp/msql-patch1
</pre>
 
    The &quot;<tt>-l</tt>&quot; option is used to tell <tt>patch</tt>
    to ignore any whitespace mismatches between lines in the patch file
    and lines in the mSQL source file. (<i>That's an &quot;el&quot;,
    NOT a &quot;one&quot; or an &quot;eye&quot;</i>). <p>
 
    <tt>Patch</tt> will respond with output similar to: <p>
 
<pre>
    Hmm...  Looks like a new-style context diff to me...
    The text leading up to this was:
    --------------------------
    |*** ./src/msql/net.c.orig        Tue Oct 17 11:24:03 1995
    |--- ./src/msql/net.c     Tue Dec 12 15:24:11 1995
    --------------------------
    Patching file ./src/msql/net.c using Plan A...
    Hunk #1 succeeded at 66.
    Hunk #2 succeeded at 84.
    done
</pre>
 
    If you have problems applying the patch, you may wish to consider
    using some or all of the following arguments to patch: <p>
 
    <ul>
	<li><b>-b</b> <p>
 
	forces <tt>patch</tt> to create a backup of the original file.
	By default it adds a <i>.orig</i> suffix to the original
	filename. <p>
 
	<li><b>-N</b> <p>
 
	forces <tt>patch</tt> to ignore patches that it thinks are
	reversed or already applied. <p>
 
	<li><b>-p0</b> (<i>That's a &quot;zero&quot;, NOT an
	&quot;oh&quot;</i>).<p>
 
	forces <tt>patch</tt> to honour the full pathname of the files
	listed in the patch file.
 
    </ul>
    <p>
 
 
    <li> Recompile mSQL. If you have <a href="#other-apps">third party
    applications</a> that use the mSQL library, you'll probably have to
    <a href="#recompile">recompile</a> them as well.

The mailing list discusses issues that arise from the use of mSQL and
W3-mSQL (both products developed by David Hughes). Often discussions on
contributed software arise but it is probably best to take these
discussions off line and summarise solutions back to the list. <p>
 
Traffic on the list is fairly high. There were approximately 1100
postings between April 1 1996 and May 31 1996 which gives an average of
around 550 messages per month. (If you think this is high, try
subscribing to the firewalls list - this has an average of around 1000
postings per month!) <p>
 
Turn around times for postings can sometimes be a little slow. It is
not unusual for messages sent from Australia to take a few hours to
appear on the list. List subscribers from other countries have also
reported similar turn around times. Please be patient. <p>

<h3><a name="news-group">Is there a news group for mSQL?</a></h3>
 
No. <p>
 
This question comes up about every three months  or so - usually from
new subscribers to the <a href="#mailing-list">mSQL mailing list</a>
who haven't seen the previous threads. <p>
 
There seem to be two distinct groups of people involved in this
discussion: <p>
 
<ol>
    <li> Those who prefer the mailing list. <p>
 
	<ul>
	    <li> News turn around times can be horrendously slow. It
	    is not uncommon for messages to appear in Australia up to
	    seven (7) days after they were originally posted.
	    Considering that mSQL is developed and supported in
	    Australia, a news group would pose an unacceptable delay
	    in providing support for mSQL. <p>
 
	    <li> The mailing list is well established and even if a
	    news group were created, the mailing list would still
	    live on. Creation of a news group would mean that users
	    would need to track both forums in order to keep abreast
	    of current developments in mSQL. <p>
 
	    <li> Newsgroup messages expire - if you happen to be away
	    for an extended period you run the risk of losing valuable
	    information that may have expired while you were away. <p>
 
	    <li> News groups are often subject to &quot;spamming&quot;
	    whereas mailing lists are less vulnerable. <p>
 
	    <li> Signal to noise ratios on news groups tend to be
	    lower than mailing lists (even when instances of
	    &quot;spamming&quot; are discounted). <p>
 
	    <li> Not everyone who subscribes to the mSQL mailing list
	    has a news feed. Establishment of a news group would
	    immediately isolate those mSQL users from any discussions
	    carried out within the news group. <p>
 
            <li> Not everyone has access to a full news feed. Some
            people have difficulty in obtaining permission to receive
            new news groups. Establishment of a news group would
            immediately isolate those mSQL users from any discussions
            carried out within the news group.
	</ul>
	<p>
 
    <li> Those who would prefer a news group. <p>
 
	<ul>
	    <li> A news group allows mSQL related messages to be
	    isolated from other messages. This can be resolved by
	    using mail filtering or threaded mail readers. Examples of
	    mail filtering include <tt>procmail</tt> and <tt>filter</tt>
	    (which is distributed with the Elm mail reader). Release
	    2.<i>x</i> and above of the Netscape Navigator includes a
	    threaded mail reader. <p>
 
	    <li> The volume of messages on the mSQL list is
	    increasing, making it difficult to keep track of threads.
	    This can be alleviated using the methods described above.
	    <p>
 
            <li> It is often more cost effective for some users to
            receive blocks of news rather than individual mail messages.
            Similar behaviour can be achieved by subscribing to the
	    <a href="#mailing-list-digest">mSQL mailing list digest</a>.
	</ul>
</ol>
 
While opinion is divided among these camps, the dominant force at
present is for the mailing list to continue without the establishment
of a global newsgroup. However, this does not preclude you from
setting up a local news/mail gateway such that incoming mail items are
sent to a local newsgroup at your site and outgoing news postings are
sent to the mailing list. Consult your <tt>nntp</tt> documentation for
more details. <p>
 
Nor does it preclude you from establishing a global news group. There
are well defined channels established within the Usenet community for
the creation of new news groups. <p>
 
One publicly available mail/news gateway is available via anonymous
ftp from:

<h3><a name="posting">How do I post a question to the</a>
<a href="#mailing-list">mSQL mailing list?</a></h3>
 
Before you post a question to the mSQL mailing list, read the manual
that came with the mSQL distribution as well as the rest of this FAQ.
Also, ask yourself the following question: <p>
 
<pre>
    Is there any way I can find the answer to this question myself?
</pre>
 
If you can figure out a way to simply find the answer, then it will
probably be quicker than asking the list. If you think your answer
would be helpful to others then post a summary to the mailing list.

    <li> the operating system and version - for example Solaris 2.4 or
    HP-UX 9.05
 
    <li> the processor you are using - for example sparc or Intel 486
 
    <li> include the output of &quot;<tt>msqladmin version</tt>&quot;
 
    <li> which, if any, <a href="#recommended-patches">unofficial
    patches</a> you have applied to the version of mSQL you're using
 
    <li> include a dump of a test database using <tt>msqldump</tt>
 
    <li> include an mSQL script that will show the bug
</ul>
 
You should also ensure that you are running the
<a href="#current-version">latest</a> (stable) version of mSQL before
posting a bug report as David fixes bugs in every version. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="contrib-patches">How do I contribute a patch to
mSQL?</a></h3>
 
Following this procedure will standardise the manner in which unofficial
mSQL patches are distributed to the mSQL user community. <p>
 
<ol>
    <li> Ensure that you are patching the
    <a href="#current-version">latest</a> version of mSQL. <p>
 
    <li> Ensure that you have applied any necessary
    <a href="#recommended-patches"> unofficial recommended patches</a> to
    the latest version. <p>
 
    <li> Make your changes to the &quot;<tt>src</tt>&quot; hierarchy of
    mSQL. For example, if you need to patch the file: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqld.c
</pre>
 
    Save the original file as follows: <p>
 
<pre>
    cp ./src/msql/msqld.c ./src/msql/msqld.c.orig
</pre>
 
    Make your changes to the file: <p>
 
<pre>
    ./src/msql/msqld.c
</pre>
 
    <li> Test, double test and triple test your patch to make sure it
    <b>REALLY</b> fixes a problem. <p>
 
    <li> Generate a difference listing suitable for use by Larry Wall's
    <tt>patch</tt> program:
 
<pre>
    diff -c ./src/msql/msqld.c.orig ./src/msql/msqld.c
</pre>
 
    <li> Post this difference listing and an explanation of the patch to
    the <a href="#mailing-list">mSQL mailing list</a>.
 
</ol>
 
If at all possible, try to avoid posting 'monster' patches. If your
patch modifies a number of separate aspects of mSQL, split each of these
into different patches. This makes it easier for people to apply
feature specific patches to mSQL while avoiding unwanted feature
patches. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="contrib-code">How do I contribute code to the mSQL
community?</a></h3>
 
Contributed code can be uploaded to the ftp server at
<a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a> Australia. Place your
code in the directory: <p>
 
<pre>
    <a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Incoming">ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Incoming</a>
</pre>
 
then notify David at
<a href="mailto:bambi@hughes.com.au">&lt;bambi@hughes.com.au&gt;</a>.
He will move your contribution to the mSQL
<a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib">contributions</a>
directory: <p>
 
<pre>
    <a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib">ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib</a>

<b>Note:</b> The directory permissions for
<a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Incoming">
<tt>ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Incoming</tt></a> prohibit the
viewing of any files contained therein. This is a security feature
implemented by the system administration staff at
<a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a> to eliminate recent
attempts to use the ftp server as a relay for the unauthorised transfer
of commercial software. If you upload any software to this directory,
you must notify
<a href="mailto:bambi@hughes.com.au">&lt;bambi@hughes.com.au&gt;</a> to
have it moved to <a href="ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib">
<tt>ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib</tt></a>. <p>
 
You may like to discuss your proposed code with others on the
<a href="#mailing-list">mSQL mailing list</a>. The subscribers to this
list may be able to help you with improvements or modifications to your
code or advise you of work already available in your area. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="code-examples">Where can I find examples of code that
interface with mSQL?</a></h3>
 
If you're writing code in the C programming language, examine the mSQL
distribution itself. All the auxiliary programs use the mSQL
<a href="#api">API</a> in a variety of ways. Pay particular attention
to: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> <a href="#support-progs"><tt>./src/msql/msql.c</tt></a>
    <li> <a href="#support-progs"><tt>./src/msql/relshow.c</tt></a>
    <li> <a href="#support-progs"><tt>./src/msql/msqldump.c</tt></a>
    <li> <a href="#support-progs"><tt>./src/msql/msqladmin.c</tt></a>
</ul>
 
If you're writing code in other languages, have a look through the
distribution of the mSQL language extension itself for examples.
Another good place to look is the <a href="#list-archives">mSQL mailing
list archives</a>. <p>

<p>
 
For more details see the documentation that comes with mSQL version
2.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="keys">Does mSQL support keys?</a></h3>
 
Yes. <p>
 
Under mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> any single field of a table can be
designated as the <tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt>. These keys are, by definition,
unique. mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> does not support multiple keys within
a table.  <p>
 
The creation of a <tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt> is made during the table
declaration, for example: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE employee (
	employee_number		INT PRIMARY KEY,
	department		CHAR(20),
	first_name		CHAR(20) NON NULL,
	last_name		CHAR(20) NON NULL
    )
 
    CREATE TABLE department (
	department_name		CHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY
    )
</pre>
 
For more details see the documentation that comes with mSQL version
1.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> has disposed of the <tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt>
in favour of an indexing mechanism. <p>
 
An <tt>INDEX</tt> may be created for any field of a table at any time,
for example: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx1 ON employee(employee_number)
    CREATE INDEX idx2 ON employee(first_name, last_name)
</pre>
 
This examples shows that the first <tt>INDEX</tt>, <i>idx1</i>, is
unique. This is identical to the <tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt> concept used by
mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>. The second <tt>INDEX</tt>, <i>idx2</i>, need
not be unique. <i>idx2</i> also spans two fields within a table which
will improve performance whenever a search is made based on these two
fields. <p>
 
These indices will be used automatically whenever a query is sent to
the database engine that uses those fields in its <tt>WHERE</tt>
clause. The user is not required to specify any special values in the
query to ensure the indices are used to increase performance. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="datatypes">What datatypes are supported?</a></h3>
 
mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> supports the following datatypes: <p>
 
<pre>
    int		(4 bytes)	-2147483646 &lt;= i &lt;= 2147483647
    real	(8 bytes)	4.94E-324 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.79E+308, -1.79E+308 &lt;= x &lt;= -4.94E-324
    char
</pre>
 
The internal storage for types <tt>int</tt> and <tt>real</tt> is held at
4 bytes and 8 bytes respectively, regardless of the system architecture
you're using. So even on 64 bit Crays a <tt>real</tt> will be 8 bytes.
<p>
 
There is NO fixed limit on the size of a character field. Provided you
declare it correctly when the table is defined, mSQL will handle
fields of at least several thousand characters without problems. You
may run into difficulty actually using fields of this size in whatever
language you choose to interface to the mSQL database engine. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> If you declare a <tt>char</tt> field with a large size,
each and every row in the table will allocate sufficient storage space
for the <tt>char</tt> field - whether the full size of the field is
used or not. This may lead to very large database tables indeed. <p>
 
An example of each mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> datatype within a table
declaration follows: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE <i>table_name</i> (
	    <i>field_name_1</i>	INT PRIMARY KEY,
	    <i>field_name_2</i>	REAL,
	    <i>field_name_3</i>	CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	    <i>field_name_4</i>	CHAR(80),
	    <i>field_name_5</i>	INT	NOT NULL,
	    <i>field_name_6</i>	REAL
	)
</pre>
 
For more details see the documentation that comes with mSQL version
1.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> supports the following datatypes: <p>
 
<pre>
    int		(4 bytes)	-2147483646 &lt;= i &lt;= 2147483647
    uint	(4 bytes)	0 &lt;= i &lt;= 4294967295
    real	(8 bytes)	4.94E-324 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.79E+308, -1.79E+308 &lt;= x &lt;= -4.94E-324
    char
    text
    date
    time
    money
</pre>
 
The internal storage for types <tt>int/uint</tt> and <tt>real</tt> is
held at 4 bytes and 8 bytes respectively, regardless of the system
architecture you're using. So even on 64 bit Crays a <tt>real</tt> will
be 8 bytes.  <p>
 
There is NO fixed limit on the size of a character field. Provided you
declare it correctly when the table is defined, mSQL will handle
fields of at least several thousand characters without problems. You
may run into difficulty actually using fields of this size in whatever
language you choose to interface to the mSQL database engine. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> If you declare a <tt>char</tt> field with a large size,
each and every row in the table will allocate sufficient storage space
for the <tt>char</tt> field - whether the full size of the field is
used or not. This may lead to very large database tables indeed. <p>
 
<tt>text</tt> (or other 8 bit data) fields are defined with an expected
average length. Values longer than the specified length will be split
between the data table and external overflow buffers. <tt>text</tt>
fields are slower to access than <tt>char</tt> fields and cannot be
used in an <tt>index</tt> or in <tt>LIKE</tt> tests. <p>
 
An example of each mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> datatype within a table
declaration follows: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE <i>table_name</i> (
	    <i>field_name_1</i>		INT,
	    <i>field_name_2</i>		REAL,
	    <i>field_name_3</i>		CHAR(10)	NOT NULL,
	    <i>field_name_4</i>		CHAR(80),
	    <i>field_name_5</i>		INT		NOT NULL,
	    <i>field_name_6</i>		REAL,
	    <i>field_name_7</i>		TEXT(25),
	    <i>field_name_8</i>		DATE,
	    <i>field_name_9</i>		UINT,
	    <i>field_name_10</i>		TIME,
	    <i>field_name_11</i>		MONEY
	)
</pre>
 
<b>Note:</b> The storage of real numbers is highly machine dependent.
If you store the number <tt>10.03</tt> don't be surprised if it is
actually stored as either <tt>10.03</tt> or <tt>10.03000000001</tt> or
<tt>10.02999999999</tt>. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> The upper and lower limits for real numbers are also
highly machine dependent. Both mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> and 2.<i>x</i>
obtain these values from the system include file: <p>
 
<pre>
    /usr/include/limits.h
</pre>
 
If you plan on storing very big numbers (positive or negative numbers
with exponents approaching 308) or very small numbers (positive or
negative numbers with exponents approaching -324) you <b>MUST</b> check
whether your operating system will support them. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> When dealing with real numbers it might be advisable to
either convert the real number to an integer if possible. For example
if you are dealing with decimal currency, it may be preferable to work
in units of cents rather than dollars - <b>note</b> that mSQL
2.<i>x</i> now has a <tt>MONEY</tt> type which handles this concept -
or to perform some sort of delta check when retrieving values. The
following logic demonstrates one possible application of this concept:
<p>
 
<pre>
    delta = 0.00001
    select a real number from a table
 
    if abs(number - expected value) &lt; delta
    then
	proceed
    else
	fail

<h3><a name="views">Are views or virtual tables supported?</a></h3>
 
No. <p>
 
This feature may be included in mSQL version 2. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="table-aliasing">Does mSQL support table aliasing?</a></h3>
 
Yes. <p>
 
As an example, consider this method to find the list of grandparents
from a child/parent tuple: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT t1.parent, t2.child from parent_data=t1,parent_data=t2
	WHERE t1.child=t2.parent
</pre>
 
mSQL also supports the SQL standard method of table aliasing which uses
either a space character or the keyword AS instead of an = character.
So the above example can also be written as either: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT t1.parent, t2.child from parent_data t1,parent_data t2
	WHERE t1.child=t2.parent
</pre>
 
or

<h3><a name="stored-procedures">Are stored procedures

No - that's getting beyond the scope of Mini SQL (see Oracle :) <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="acl">Are access privileges supported?</a></h3>
 
Yes. <p>
 
mSQL has an access control file which allows the database administrator
to control access on a user and host level. <p>
 
For more details see the documentation that comes with mSQL. <p>
 
mSQL does not support access control from within SQL commands. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="blobs">Does mSQL support BLOBs?</a></h3>
 
BLOBs are <b>B</b>inary <b>L</b>arge <b>OB</b>jects. Typical examples
would be large blocks of text, graphics or audio data. <p>
 
The current release of mSQL has NO direct support for BLOBs. However,
you can always store the path name of a file that points to the BLOB in
one of the fields of your table. Then your application can deal with
the file name appropriately. <p>
 
If you're dealing with large blocks of text, you may also wish to
consider this approach from Pascal Forget
<a href="mailto:pascal@wsc.com">&lt;pascal@wsc.com&gt;</a>: <p>
 
<pre>
    Another possible hack would be to have the &quot;block_text&quot;
    record contain a pointer to a &quot;text_lines&quot; table. This
    table would contain a linked list of text lines like this:
 
	CREATE TABLE text_lines (
	    line_id	int primary key,
	    string	char(80),
	    next_line	int
	)
</pre>
 
Mike Eggleston
<a href="mailto:mikee@sys8.wfc.com">&lt;mikee@sys8.wfc.com&gt;</a>
offers this solution: <p>
 
<pre>
    What I prefer to do in databases where I have text fields containing
    near infinite amounts of text is to define several tables like:
 
	create table prog (
	  id int,
	  name char(40),
	  programmer char(40),
	  ....
	)\p\g
 
	create table descript (
	  id int,
	  line int,
	  descript char(100)
	)\p\g
 
    Then in a program I break up the text as necessary and put one line
    of text in each record of &lt;descript&gt;. When I want it back, by
    program, I [use]
 
	select line, descript from prog, descript
	    where prog.id = descript.id
	    and name = 'foobar' order by line\p\g
</pre>
 
Later versions of mSQL may have support for BLOBs. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="transactions">Are the transaction commands, BEGIN, COMMIT,
and ROLLBACK supported?</a></h3>
 
No, and they will probably never be supported (once again that's beyond
the scope of mSQL).<p>
 
The mSQL server handles requests serially - that is only one user's
request is handled at a time. Therefore there is no danger of a user
reading from a table that is currently being updated by another user.
<p>
 
However, there is the possibility that the same read operations may
straddle another user's write operation so that different data will be
returned from each read. <p>
 
mSQL version 2 will provide client initiated locking. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="table-limits">What are the limits on table and field
names?</a></h3>
 
A table or field name MUST begin with an alphabetic character. The
remainder of the name may be any of the following 63 characters: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 
    <li> a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
 
    <li> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 
    <li> _ <i>(that's an &quot;underbar&quot; NOT a
    &quot;dash&quot;)</i>
</ul>
 
The maximum name length is set to 20 characters. That's for a table or
a field in a table. This allows for
813621925049196536663393538834956800 possible naming combinations using
the characters listed above. For the mathematically inclined that's:
<p>
 
<pre>
	   19
	 -----
	 \
	  \        i
   52 *   /      63   =   813621925049196536663393538834956800
	 /
	 -----
	 i = 0
</pre>
 
Though in practise, many of these combinations will probably remain
unused. <p>
 
While not recommended, the default maximum name length value of 20 can
be changed by editing the mSQL source code. However, if you change it
AFTER you have already created ANY databases, the old databases will be
unreadable. To avoid this problem, follow this procedure: <p>
 
<ol>
 
    <li> Dump your old databases to ASCII files using
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqldump</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Drop your old databases using
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Shutdown the mSQL database server
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a> using
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Edit the mSQL source and modify
 
<pre>
    ./src/msql/msql_priv.h
</pre>
 
    Change the line reading <p>
 
<pre>
    #define NAME_LEN	19		/* Field/table name length */
</pre>
 
    to suit your needs. Ensure that you use a number that is one less
    than the maximum value you desire. For example, if you wish to have
    a name length of 36 you would change the line to read: <p>
 
<pre>
    #define NAME_LEN	35		/* Field/table name length */
</pre>
 
    <li> Recompile and install the modified mSQL. <p>
 
    <li> Start the new mSQL database server
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Create new databases using
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Repopulate your databases using
    <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msql</tt></a> and the ASCII dumps from
    step 1.
 
</ol>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="user-limits">What other limits can be modified?</a></h3>
 
The file <p>
 
<pre>
    ./src/msql/msql_priv.h
</pre>
 
contains the definitions of the internal mSQL limits: <p>
 
<pre>
    #define MAX_FIELDS	75		/* Max fields per query */
    #define MAX_CON	24		/* Max connections */
    #define BUF_SIZE	(256*1024)	/* Read buf size if no mmap() */
    #define NAME_LEN	19		/* Field/table name length */
    #define PKT_LEN	(32*1024)	/* Max size of client/server packet */
    #define CACHE_SIZE	8		/* Size of table cache */
</pre>
 
If you want to increase them you can just edit this file and recompile.
Don't change MAX_CON or CACHE_SIZE without understanding why these
limits are set (maximum file descriptors per process etc). <p>
 
Changing any of these parameters will almost certainly make any
existing databases unreadable. To avoid this problem, follow this
procedure: <p>
 
<ol>
 
    <li> Dump your old databases to ASCII files using
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqldump</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Drop your old databases using
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Shutdown the mSQL database server
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a> using
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Edit the mSQL source and modify
 
<pre>
    ./src/msql/msql_priv.h
</pre>
 
    changing the definitions to suit your needs. <p>
 
    <li> Recompile and install the modified mSQL. <p>
 
    <li> Start the new mSQL database server
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Create new databases using
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. <p>
 
    <li> Repopulate your databases using
	<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msql</tt></a> and the ASCII dumps
	from step 1.

<h3><a name="db-size">How much data can mSQL address?</a></h3>
 
mSQL can theoretically address tables with a maximum size of 4
gigabytes. In practise you'll probably run up against operating system
limitations well before this theoretical limit. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="expressions">Are there any limitations in the way mSQL
handles logical expressions?</a></h3>
 
mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> has a very simplistic approach to logical
expressions. <p>
 
Consider the SQL query: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT something from somewhere WHERE
	name='jan' or country='italy' and sex='female' or title='ms'
</pre>
 
Under mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>, the parser will scan the condition
from left to right. So in this example the condition reads: <p>
 
<pre>
    ((name='jan' or country='italy') and sex='female') or title='ms'
</pre>
 
mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> does NOT support parentheses in logical
expressions, so there is <b>NO</b> way to change this parsing. <p>

three component queries. <p>
 
Ted writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    Let's get something clear: ALL 3-component (or equivalent) queries
    can be implemented in mSQL (without parentheses and using the mSQL
    left-to-right evaluation). There are only the following:
 
	    (A and B) and C  =  A and (B and C)  =  A and B and C
	    (A or B) or C    =  A or (B or C)    =  A or B or C
	    (A and B) or C   =  A and B or C
	    A and (B or C)   =  (B or C) and A   =  B or C and A
	    (A or B) and C   =  A or B and C
	    A or (B and C)   =  (B and C) or A   =  B and C or A
 
    Queries like A and B and C and (E or F) are the same as (A and B
    and C) and (E or F) which is the same form as G and (E or F).
 
    The trouble starts with 4-component queries such as (A or B) and (C
    or D) for which there is no one-pass generally correct mSQL
    representation.
</pre>
 
mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> allows parentheses within logical expressions
so this limitation is eliminated. <p>

<h3><a name="return-values">How does mSQL return values?</a></h3>
 
mSQL returns all values as ASCII strings. If, for example, you are
expecting an integer result you may have to do some internal
conversions depending on the language you're using. <p>
 
In C, for example, see the manual pages on <tt>atoi()</tt>. <p>

    This is guaranteed. The only time the rows will be returned in

    I am new at mSQL, and have a beginner question: Is it possible to

</pre>
 
David Hughes replied: <p>
 
<pre>
    You can't nest tables in mSQL (don't think you can in ANSI SQL
    either). What you can do is to use a common value as a key to join
    the contents of two tables (eg. a part number or a user ID).
</pre>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="storage-overhead">What storage overheads does mSQL
have?</a></h3>
 
mSQL stores each database in its own directory under the
'<tt>msqldb</tt>' directory of wherever you specified mSQL should be
installed. For example if you specified that mSQL should be installed
in: <p>
 
<pre>
    /usr/local/Minerva/
</pre>
 
then the databases will be created in the directory: <p>
 
<pre>
    /usr/local/Minerva/msqldb/
</pre>
 
<b>Note</b> that this can be overridden by specifying the MSQL_HOME
environment variable when starting
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a>. <p>
 
Each table in the database is stored as a number of files: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li><b><i>dbname/table</i>.dat</b> - table data. This file contains
    the data for all the rows in the table. <p>
 
    For each field in a table, mSQL will also store an additional flag
    byte. mSQL also stores an additional flag byte for each row of the
    table. <p>
 
    Consider the following table: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE test (
	f0	char(13),
	f1	int,
	f2	real,
	f3	real,
	f4	real,
	f5	real,
	f6	int
    )
</pre>
 
    Storage space for each row of this table would be: <p>
 
<pre>
    (13 * char) + (2 * int) + (4 * double) + (7 * fields) + (1 * rows)
	=  (13 * 1) + (2 * 4) + (4 * 8) + (7 * 1) + 1
	=  61 bytes
</pre>
 
    So if this table had 1000 records, it would occupy 61000 bytes of
    disk space. (In reality it may occupy slightly more real disk space
    because of the way the underlying file system behaves. This is
    operating system specific and not really an issue to worry about.
    If you do an '<tt>ls -l</tt>' on the file it will show 61000
    bytes). <p>
 
    <li><b><i>dbname/table</i>.key</b> - table keys. This file will
    only exist if the table has a primary key. It contains the key
    pointers into the table data file. <p>
 
    The size of this file will be the size of the key plus one flag
    byte times the number of rows in the table. In the above example,
    if the table was defined as: <p>
 
<pre>
    CREATE TABLE test (
	f0	char(13) primary key,
	f1	int,
	f2	real,
	f3	real,
	f4	real,
	f5	real,
	f6	int
    )
</pre>
 
    and the table had 1000 rows, the size of the data file would still
    be 61000 bytes and the size of the key file would be: <p>
 
<pre>
    ((13 * char) + 1) * 1000
	=  ((13 * 1) + 1) * 1000
	=  14 * 1000
	=  14000 bytes
</pre>
 
    <li><b><i>dbname/table</i>.def</b> - table definition. This file
    contains the table structure definition. <p>
 
    Each field in the table has a 64 byte definition. Using the example
    above, the table has 7 fields so the size of the definition file
    will be: <p>
 
<pre>
    7 * 64  =  448 bytes
</pre>
 
    <li><b><i>dbname/table</i>.stk</b> - table stack. This file keeps
    track of the holes or empty rows in the table. <p>
 
    For every hole in the table, this file will contain a 4 byte
    integer indicating the row number of the hole. It is accessed like
    a stack. When a row is deleted, it's index is appended to the
    file. When an insert is done, the last 4 bytes are
    &quot;popped&quot; off the file and the file is truncated back 4
    bytes. <p>
 
    If the table contains 20 holes, the size of the stack file will be:
    <p>
 
<pre>
    20 * 4  =  80 bytes
</pre>
 
    If the table contains no holes then this file will have zero
    length.
 
</ul>
 
Therefore to calculate the storage requirements for a table, use one of
the following formulae: <p>
 
<dl>
    <dt><b>Tables with a primary key:</b>
 
    <dd>
<pre>
    table_storage_requirements
	=  expected_max_rows *
	    (
		number_of_fields + 1 + total_chars +
		(4 * total_ints) + (8 * total_reals) +
		(size_of_key + 1) +
		(4 * expected_deletion_ratio)
	    ) +
	(total_fields * 64)
</pre>
 
    <dt><b>Tables without a primary key:</b>
 
    <dd>
<pre>
    table_storage_requirements
	=  expected_max_rows *
	    (
		number_of_fields + 1 + total_chars +
		(4 * total_ints) + (8 * total_reals) +
		(4 * expected_deletion_ratio)
	    ) +
	(total_fields * 64)
</pre>
 
</dl>
 
Using the keyed table above, if we expect it to contain a maximum of
10000 rows and we expect to have a 10 percent deletion ratio (that is
at any one time we expect that 10 percent of our rows have been deleted
but not replaced by new rows), we should allow for: <p>
 
<pre>
    10000 *
	(
	    7 + 1 + 13 +
	    (4 * 2) + (8 * 4) +
	    (13 + 1) +
	    (4 * 0.10)
	) +
    (7 * 64)
 
	=  10000 * ( 21 + 8 + 32 + 14 + 0.4) + 448
	=  754448 bytes
</pre>
 
plus a handful of bytes to store file names in directories. <p>
 
<b>Note</b> that this is the maximum storage allocation. Unlike some
other database systems, mSQL only uses disk space when it has data to
add to a table - it does NOT allocate a large block of empty disk space
and then proceed to fill it. If our example only had 1000 rows the
storage requirements would only be 75848 bytes. <p>

<pre>
    If your OS supports mmap() (e.g. Solaris, SunOS, *BSD, BSDI, Linux
    1.3.x, HP-UX &gt;9.x) then the more memory you throw at it the
    better things will get if you are using big databases. The data is
    left on disk but is accessed via the virtual memory subsystem so it
    will be in memory some of the time.
 
    If you are not using mmap() then data is just read from disk as it
    is needed. There's a small buffer in the read code to make things
    faster but that's about it. It doesn't matter how many databases
    you have defined it only uses 1 buffer.

    Does performance degrade at all as the number of databases

    No. It will degrade if people are hitting the new databases at the

<h3><a name="cursors">Does mSQL support cursors?</a></h3>
 
Pascal Forget replies to a posting by Brian Bartholomew:
 
<pre>
    &gt; To browse the database, I want mSQL to return me the first row
    &gt; in the database, and keep a pointer to it. Then sometime later
    &gt; I can ask it for the second row, and so on.
 
    mSQL does not provide support for cursors.
 
    You'll have to issue a SELECT query each time you want the next
    row. mSQL has no provisions for modifying a result set once it has
    been created. I suggest you add a field containing a unique
    identifier for each row, then fetch the next row using:
 
	SELECT ... FROM mytable where unique_field &gt; last_id LIMIT 1
 
    &gt; How do I express this in sql?
 
    If you find a way to express it, it most certainly won't be in
    standard SQL, as the language has no support for cursors.
 
    &gt; I see that I could add an explicit field that was an arbitrary
    &gt; row number, and query for the current row number +/- 1, but over
    &gt; time with insertions and deletions there would be gaps and the
    &gt; query would break. How is this problem usually solved?
 
    The select statement I gave you won't break even if there are gaps
    in the unique identifiers. You can periodically &quot;compact&quot; the
    numbers if you want.

<h3><a name="intl">Does mSQL support different character sets?</a></h3>
 
Patrik Faltstrom writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    Yes, as long as the client that fetches the characters knows what
    character set you are using. I.e. there is no support in mSQL for
    keeping track of the character set name, but mSQL is 8bit clean so
    you can store 8bit characters (in whatever character set).
 
    In Digger, the Whois++ server, we store UNICODE characters by
    encoding them first into UTF-8 which is an 8bit encoding scheme
    described in UNICODE 1.1.

    AFS does not support some Unix file system behaviour that's needed

    The solution to the problem with using the socket and then nsl

    1. Do not link them if they are not needed :) This is the case for
       mSQL.
 
    or
 
    2. link libc BEFORE the socket and the nsl libraries.
 
    For those who didn't know, the problem is that if you use NIS and

    Looks like the same thing that happens under HP-UX with background

    Create yourself a wrapper for msqld. In there you do a fork and
    exit the parent process in the child process you do a call to
    setsid() to get rid of the controlling terminal followed by a call
    to execl() to launch msqld. You might also want to close all open
    file descriptors before calling exec.

An alternative to this approach is to place the following in
<tt>/etc/inittab</tt>
 
<pre>
    msql:3:respawn:/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msqld &lt;/dev/console &gt;/dev/console 2&gt;&amp;1

procedure to use the <tt>makedepend</tt> that is shipped with
OpenWindows 3.5 instead of the version of <tt>makedepend</tt> shipped
with mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
<ol>
    <li> <tt>cd msql-1.0.16/src/makegen</tt> <p>
 
    <li> edit both <tt>library.mm</tt> and <tt>object.mm</tt> and
    change all references to
 
<pre>
    @$(TOP)/makedepend/makedepend
</pre>
 
    so that they read: <p>
 
<pre>
    @/usr/openwin/bin/makedepend
</pre>
 
    <li> <tt>cd ../../targets/Solaris-2.5/Sparc</tt> <p>
 
    <li> <tt>make</tt>
 
</ol>
 
This will avoid the error messages listed above but you will now see
the following warning messages: <p>
 
<pre>
    /usr/openwin/bin/makedepend:  ignoring option -a
</pre>
 
These too can be safely ignored. <p>

<h3><a name="root-user"><tt>msqladmin</tt> will not let me create a
database</a></h3>
 
This one is straight from the manual section on
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a>. It states that the
only person who is allowed to create a database is the person nominated
as the &quot;root user&quot; during installation. If you indicated that
the database would be running as <tt>root</tt> then you must be
<tt>root</tt> to create a database. <p>
 
If you indicated that it would not be running as <tt>root</tt>, you
would have then nominated a username for the &quot;root user&quot;. In
that case, you must be logged in as the user you nominated before you
can perform admin functions like creation of databases. <p>
 
The manual also states that you can only perform the admin functions of
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a> (i.e. any function
other than 'version') from the local host. For security reasons you
cannot perform administrative functions in a client/server manner of a
network. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="acl-file">When I start <tt>msqld</tt> it complains about
an ACL file</a></h3>
 
The ACL file is the file that contains Access Control Lists for mSQL.
It is located in the installation directory and is called
<tt>msql.acl</tt> (e.g. <tt>/usr/local/Minerva/msql.acl</tt>). The
warning indicates that <tt>msqld</tt> couldn't locate an ACL file. This
doesn't stop mSQL from operating, it just implies that everyone on
every machine on your network has read/write access to your databases.
<p>
 
A sample ACL file is installed in the installation directory. You could
copy this file to <tt>msql.acl</tt> and edit it to reflect the access
you want to offer to your databases. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="pid-file">When I start <tt>msqld</tt> it complains about a
PID file</a></h3>
 
The PID file is just a file in which
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a> writes its process ID. If
it can't write to the PID file, <tt>msqld</tt> will still function
correctly. <p>
 
If you are seeing an error regarding the PID file, then one of the
following could be the cause: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> The directory in which <tt>msqld</tt> is attempting to create
    the PID file does not exist. <p>
 
    <li> The directory in which <tt>msqld</tt> is attempting to create
    the PID file does not have sufficient permissions.
</ul>
 
During the installation, the <tt>setup</tt> program asked you where to
store the PID file: <p>
 
<pre>
    Top of install tree ? [/usr/local/Minerva]
    Will this installation be running as root ? [y] n
    What username will it run under ?  peters
    Directory for pid file ? [/var/adm]
</pre>
 
You must ensure that this directory exists. The mSQL installation
procedure will NOT create this directory for you. <p>
 
If you did not specify <tt>root</tt> as the mSQL administration user
when you answered the questions: <p>
 
<pre>
    Will this installation be running as root ? [y] n
    What username will it run under ?  peters
</pre>
 
you must ensure that the user you specified has write permissions in
the directory in which <tt>msqld</tt> will store its PID file. <p>
 
Under IRIX 5.3 the <tt>/var/adm</tt> directory can only be written to
by the <tt>root</tt> user, so if your mSQL administration user is NOT
<tt>root</tt> then you'll have to choose some other location such as
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> or <tt>/var/share</tt>. <p>
 
If you need to change the location of this directory, you can either
rerun the <tt>setup</tt> program, or edit the file: <p>
 
<pre>
    ./targets/<i>your_architecture</i>/site.mm
</pre>
 
and change the line: <p>
 
<pre>
    PID_DIR= /var/adm
</pre>
 
to suit your needs. <p>

<h3><a name="recompile">I've just installed the latest version
of mSQL and now my own applications won't work!</a></h3>
 
Whenever you install a new version of mSQL you MUST remember to
recompile any third party applications - including those you developed
yourself - to ensure that they are linked with the new version of
<tt>libmsql.a</tt>. You should also recompile third party applications
after <a href="#how-to-patch">installing any patches</a> to mSQL. <p>
 
Failure to do this will almost certainly guarantee that your
applications will fail at some stage while talking to the new mSQL
database server. You may also miss out on some new feature provided by
the new mSQL API. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="setuid">Access control doesn't work with my setuid
applications</a></h3>
 
<b>Note:</b> This only applies to mSQL version 1.0.10 and previous
versions. mSQL version 1.0.12 (and above) does NOT suffer from this
problem. This section will be removed in future versions of the FAQ. It
is included in this release to accommodate the transitional period
following the recent release of version mSQL 1.0.12. <p>
 
Consider the following scenario: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> User <tt>peters</tt> is the ONLY user given read and write
    access to the database <i>test</i> by the appropriate additions to
    the <tt>msql.acl</tt> file. <p>
 
    <li> An application is created to manipulate the <i>test</i>
    database and is saved such that it is a <i>setuid peters</i>
    application: <p>
 
<pre>
    -rwsr-xr-x   1 peters   db         24576 Nov 13  1995 db_app
</pre>
 
    <li> User <tt>markp</tt> wishes to use the <i>test</i> database
    using the <tt>db_app</tt> application. Instead of the <i>setuid</i>
    nature of the application allowing <tt>markp</tt> access to the
    database, all that happens is the error message: <p>
 
<pre>
    Access to database denied
</pre>
 
</ul>
 
This occurs because of the way in which mSQL passes user information to
the database server. It uses the <i>getuid()</i> system call which
returns the real user id of the calling process rather than the
effective user id. <p>
 
mSQL version 2 will have radically different security mechanisms. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="address-in-use">Why do I see an &quot;<tt>Address already
in use</tt>&quot; error message when I attempt to start
<tt>msqld</tt>?</a></h3>
 
If you're running Linux or SCO Unix, this message can be seen if you
killed the <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a> process WITHOUT
executing: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqladmin shutdown
</pre>
 
The TCP/IP port will remain bound for about 90 seconds or so. After
this time the port should be available and <tt>msqld</tt> can be
started successfully. <p>
 
Another possibility to consider is that something is already using the
TCP/IP port that <a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a> is trying
to use. For a default installation these port numbers are 1112 for a
root user or 4333 for an ordinary user. In this case <i>user</i> means
the name of the user you entered when answering the setup question(s):
<p>
 
<pre>
    Will this installation be running as root ?
    What username will it run under ?
</pre>
 
There are a number of ways you can check for something using the TCP/IP
port: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li><b>msql</b> <p>
 
    If the mSQL monitor program <tt>msql</tt> can connect to the mSQL
    database server <tt>msqld</tt> then you KNOW that the database
    server is already running. <p>
 
    <li><b>Telnet</b> <p>
 
    Telnet to the database server and specify the mSQL TCP/IP port
    number using one of the following commands: <p>
 
<pre>
    telnet <i>dbhost</i> 1112
</pre>
 
or
 
<pre>
    telnet <i>dbhost</i> 4333
</pre>
 
    You'll see the following types of messages: <p>
 
    <ul>
 
    <li> Nothing is using that port or something is using the port
	exclusively: <p>
 
<pre>
    Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
    telnet: connect: Connection refused
    telnet&gt;
</pre>
 
    <li><tt>msqld</tt> version 1.0.10 running protocol version 6 is
    using the port: <p>
 
<pre>
    Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
 
    0:6:1.0.10
</pre>
 
    <li> Something else is using the port (or a client process is still
    communicating with a running <tt>msqld</tt> process: <p>
 
<pre>
    Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>
 
    </ul>
 
    <li><b>netstat</b> <p>
 
    If your operating system has the <tt>netstat</tt> command, you can
    use it to display the contents of various network related data
    structures in various formats, depending on the options you
    select.
 
    Some of the options that may be helpful are: <p>
 
    <ul>
 
    <li> To determine if something is listening on port 4333, use: <p>
 
<pre>
    netstat -a | grep 4333
</pre>
 
    If you see output similar to:
 
<pre>
      *.4333	*.*	0	0	0	0	LISTEN
</pre>
 
    then something is using that port. <p>
 
    <li> To see if <tt>msqld</tt> is using the port, use: <p>
 
<pre>
    netstat -f unix
</pre>
 
    Output similar to the following will indicate that <tt>msqld</tt>
    is already running: <p>
 
<pre>
    Active UNIX domain sockets
    Address  Type          Vnode     Conn Addr
    fcf8bca8 stream-ord      231        0 /tmp/msql.sock
</pre>
 
    This may not work for all operating systems. - the above examples
    were taken from a Solaris 2.4 system. Variations on this command
    include: <p>
 
<pre>
    netstat -f inet
</pre>
 
    or
 
<pre>
    netstat -f local
</pre>
 
    </ul>
 
</ul>
 
If you found something using the TCP/IP port that <tt>msqld</tt> would
like to use, examine the output of your operating system's <tt>ps</tt>
command to check if you already have a running <tt>msqld</tt> process.
If you have then shut it down it by executing: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqladmin shutdown
</pre>
 
If you don't have a running <tt>msqld</tt> process then something else
may be using the port that <tt>msqld</tt> is trying to use. Examine
<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/services</tt> (or the services
NIS map if you're running NIS) to see if anything else is using the
port. The output from one of the <tt>netstat</tt> commands listed
above may be helpful. <p>
 
If you find such a program you have two options: <p>
 
<ol>
    <li> Change the port number the other program is using so that it
    doesn't conflict with mSQL <p>
 
    <li> Ensure that mSQL uses a different port number. This can be done
    by either: <p>
 
	<ul>
	    <li> starting <tt>msqld</tt> with the environment variable
	    MSQL_TCP_PORT set to another port number. You'll also have
	    to ensure that client applications use the new port number
	    too. <p>
 
	    <li> modifying the <tt>./src/common/site.h</tt> file and
	    changing the section
 
<pre>
    /*
    ** TCP port for the MSQL daemon
    */
 
    #ifdef ROOT_EXEC
    #define MSQL_PORT       1112
    #else
    #define MSQL_PORT       4333
    #endif
</pre>
 
	    to suit your needs. Then recompile and reinstall mSQL.
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="bind-permissions">Why do I see a &quot;<tt>Can't start
server : UNIX Bind : Permission denied</tt>&quot; error message when I
attempt to start <tt>msqld</tt>?</a></h3>
 
This usually occurs because of a permission problem involving the Unix
domain socket used by
<tt>msqld</tt> when it communicates with processes on the same host as
itself. <p>
 
Under mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> this file is typically
<tt>/dev/msql</tt> or <tt>/tmp/msql.sock</tt> while under mSQL
version 2.<i>x</i> it is typically <tt>%I/msql2.sock</tt> where
<tt>%I</tt> is a reference to the directory specified by
<tt>Inst_Dir</tt> in the mSQL configuration file. <p>
 
These permission problems usually involve the socket itself or the
directory in which it resides. The general rule here is that the
directory should have read and write permission for the mSQL root user,
and the socket (or named pipe on some operating systems) should be
owned by the mSQL root user. (<b>Note:</b> The mSQL root user is the
user you specified during the setup stage during the installation of
mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> or the user specified in the
<tt>msql.conf</tt> file for mSQL version 2.<i>x</i>). <p>
 
Some operating systems, such as HP-UX 10.<i>x</i>, ship with
<tt>dr-xr-xr-x</tt> permissions on <tt>/dev</tt> which makes it
difficult for <tt>msqld</tt> to write to the socket. In these
circumstances a better place for the socket would be
<tt>/var/msql</tt>. <p>
 
The installation instructions for mSQL 2.<i>x</i> state: <p>
 
<pre>
    8.      Ensure that the installation directory (and everything under it)
	    is owned by the user that mSQL will run as (e.g. the msql user).
	    To do this, issue a command like "chown -R msql /usr/local/Hughes".
	    Substitute the correct username and installation directory if
	    you are running a non-default installation.
</pre>
 
If you decide to place the mSQL Unix domain socket in one of the
temporary directories such as <tt>/tmp</tt> <tt>/usr/tmp</tt> or
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> please read the section in this FAQ titled
<a href="#socket-location">&quot;Where did my mSQL socket file
go?&quot;</a> <p>
 
You should also read the section in this FAQ titled
<a href="#socket-location">&quot;Where did my mSQL socket file
go?&quot;</a> if your operating system does not ship with write
permission on <tt>/dev</tt>. <p>
 
<hr>
 
 
<h3><a name="tmpdir">Why do I see &quot;<tt>Couldn't create temporary
table</tt>&quot; error messages?</a></h3>
 
mSQL uses a temporary area to store the results of table joins while
it is processing a query. This area lives in the directory: <p>
 
<pre>
    msqldb/.tmp
</pre>
 
under the directory in which you elected to install mSQL. <p>
 
If the <tt>.tmp</tt> directory does not exist, or doesn't have
permissions that allow the mSQL super user to create files then you'll
see the "<tt>Couldn't create temporary table</tt>" message. <p>
 
To fix this, check for the existence of the directory and ensure
that it has permissions:
 
<pre>
    drwxr-xr-x   2 <i>owner</i>  <i>group</i>      512 Jan 28 16:10 .tmp
</pre>
 
where <i>owner</i> is the user name of the mSQL super user and
<i>group</i> is whatever is appropriate to the way in which you want to
run your system (in other words it isn't terribly important in this
case). <p>
 
If you're going to do really big table joins then have a look at the
section in the FAQ titled <a href="#tmp-space">&quot;How can I avoid
running out of space when doing certain complex table joins?&quot;</a>.
<p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="tmp-space">How can I avoid running out of space when doing
certain complex table joins?</a></h3>
 
Some mSQL operations involving table joins can consume large amounts of
temporary disk space. You can change the location of this temporary
storage area using the following procedure: <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> Shutdown the mSQL database server. <p>
 
<pre>
    msqladmin shutdown
</pre>
 
    <li> Remove the <tt>msqldb/.tmp</tt> directory from your mSQL
    installation directory. For example, if you installed mSQL in
    <tt>/usr/local/Minerva</tt> run the following command: <p>
 
<pre>
    rm -rf /usr/local/Minerva/msqldb/.tmp
</pre>
 
    <li> Create a symbolic link from a directory with lots of space to
    the <tt>msqldb/.tmp</tt> directory: <p>
 
<pre>
    ln -s /<i>lots</i>/<i>of</i>/<i>space</i> /usr/local/Minerva/msqldb/.tmp
</pre>
 
    <li> Restart the mSQL database server.

<h3><a name="bzero-missing"><tt>msqld</tt> is suddenly dumping core and
complaining about <tt>bzero()</tt></a></h3>
 
Rasmus Lerdorf writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    This looks to me like you have compiled your msqld binary on a
    machine with bzero() in your libc but you are running it on a
    machine that does not have the bzero() function in its libc. Could
    it be that you compiled on a Solaris 2.5 box, but you are running
    it on a Solaris 2.4 machine? Sun made the brilliant decision to add
    bzero, bcopy and rindex to the Solaris 2.5 libc which means that
    Solaris 2.5 and 2.4 are not completely binary compatible anymore.
    When you compile msql on Solaris 2.5 it will see that bzero and
    bcopy are available and thus try to use them.
 
    The fix is to either link your msqld statically with the Solaris
    2.5 libc, or perhaps more preferable, recompile msql to not use the
    silly bzero, bcopy, bcmp and rindex functions.
 
    Edit common/config.h and make sure you do not have HAVE_BCOPY and
    HAVE_RINDEX defined. If you do, comment out these definitions and
    recompile. The resulting binary should then run on both target
    machines.

    I've seen this on Solaris if you link against the oh so broken BSD

    6.19) Why doesn't readdir work?  It chops the first two characters of
	all filenames.
 
	You're probably linking with libucb and didn't read question
	6.18. Readdir in libucb.so wants you to include sys/dir.h,
	but many SunOS 4.1.x programs included &lt;dirent.h&gt;,
	consequently, you're mixing native &lt;dirent.h&gt; struct dirent
	with libucb readdir(). The symptom of this mixup is that the
	first two characters of each filename are missing. Make sure
	you use the native compiler (default /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc,
	which may not be in your PATH), and not /usr/ucb/cc.

If you haven't shelled out the cash for Sun's compiler you can

<h3><a name="aix-compress">Why won't mSQL work with the compressed file

It seems that mSQL will corrupt its database files if they are stored

yet clear but may be related to AIX's implementation of <tt>mmap()</tt>.

The corruption can be avoided by ensuring that the database files are

    At 12:10 PM 9/17/96, I wrote:
    &gt;I'm trying to install mSQL on a MachTen BSD unix system and am having
    &gt;problems. The compile and installation went great (with only a warning
    &gt;that it could not detect 'uname' on the system). But when I tried to start
    &gt;the server from root with:
    &gt;
    &gt;/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msqld&amp;
    &gt;
    &gt;I get the following:
    &gt;
    &gt;Can't start server : UNIX Bind : Invalid argument
    &gt;
    &gt;Anyone have any suggestions on what I am doing wrong or what is missing?
 
 
    Thought I'd let everyone know what the problem was in case anyone else is
    thinking of using MachTen BSD Unix
 
    There's a bug in the &lt;sys/un.h&gt; file.  It reads:
 
    /*
     * Definitions for UNIX IPC domain.
     */
    struct  sockaddr_un {
	    short   sun_family;             /* AF_UNIX */
	    char    sun_path[108];          /* path name (gag) */
    };
 
 
    And it should be:
 
    /*
     * Definitions for UNIX IPC domain.
     */
    struct  sockaddr_un {
	    short   sun_family;             /* AF_UNIX */
	    char    sun_path[106];          /* path name (gag) */
    };
 
 
    It seems sun_path was a little too long and the call to 'bind' in msqld
    does a check on the parameter's structure size... thus giving an invalid
    argument error.
 
    On another note....
 
    After I got that bug fixed, the server started, but when exercising the
    tests, msql crashed MachTen!  YES... I mean crash!  So much for protected
    memory!
 
    But the real problem is yet another bug with MachTen.
 
    It seems MachTen's mmap function &quot;has not been fully
    tested&quot; (as one tech support person finally admitted). So
    while mmap exists, it really doesn't work.
 
    Borrowing from the msql FAQ:
 
	&gt;Version 1.3 or greater of the Linux operating system has full mmap support.
	&gt;If you're using such a version of Linux, mSQL will work perfectly well using
	&gt;mmap.
	&gt;
	&gt;If you have an earlier version of Linux you can either upgrade or ensure that
	&gt;mmap support in mSQL is disabled by running the 'setup' program and then
	&gt;editing
	&gt;
	&gt;    ./<i>targets/your-architecture</i>/site.mm
	&gt;
	&gt;and ensuring the mmap directive reads:
	&gt;
	&gt;    MMAP=
	&gt;
	&gt;and then recompile the mSQL package.
 
    This also works for MachTen since it seems mmap is &quot;not fully tested&quot;...
    and in reality it damn well crashed the machine.
 
    These two issues took two full days to resolve.... with calls to Tenon tech
    support in the morning, suggestions that were nowhere near fixing the
    problem during the day... and the &quot;real&quot; answers coming near 5pm when tech
    support closes... that these are bugs in MachTen.
 
    While their tech support staff was always nice and tried to be very
    helpful, I wish they would have been able to answer my questions when I
    first called.  It would have saved me two days of work on these issues.
 
    They had me try all kinds of things until the call was elevated to another
    tech (he doesn't get in until late afternoon) who had the answers... it's a
    MachTen bug!
 
    Very frustrating.
 
    However on a positive point, MachTen has been running very good as my
    internet server for the past six months or so without a glitch.

<h3><a name="socket-location">Where did my mSQL socket file
go?</a></h3>
 
Consider these two scenarios: <p>
 
<ol>
 
    <li> Your machine has just been rebooted and suddenly applications
    running on the same host cannot connect to <tt>msqld</tt>. After
    some investigation you discover that <tt>/tmp/msql.sock</tt> has
    been removed - why? <p>
 
    <li> Your mSQL database server has been running fine for a week or
    so and suddenly applications running on the same host cannot
    connect to <tt>msqld</tt>. After some investigation you discover
    that <tt>/tmp/msql.sock</tt> has been removed - why?
 
</ol>
<p>
 
You've probably been bitten by an operating feature and/or some good
system administration practise. Firstly some background. <p>
 
The two classic temporary areas under most flavours of Unix are
<tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/usr/tmp</tt> (<tt>/var/tmp</tt> in some
systems). They are usually on different file systems but don't have to
be. <p>
 
Under some versions of Unix, <tt>/tmp</tt> is cleared whenever the
system is rebooted. Other versions don't do this. Most versions of Unix
do NOT clear <tt>/usr/tmp</tt> on reboot. <p>
 
Some operating systems - such as Solaris 2.<i>x</i> and SunOS
4.<i>x</i> under certain configurations - take advantage of unused
portions of the swap partition to provide <tt>/tmp</tt>. (This happens
by default under Solaris 2.<i>x</i> and can be turned on using the
TMPFS file system under SunOS 4.<i>x</i>).  Because this area is not a
real file system <tt>/tmp</tt> only has a transient lifetime and is
guaranteed to be empty after each reboot. <p>
 
While the system is running, some versions of Unix regularly clear
<tt>/tmp</tt> and possibly <tt>/usr/tmp</tt> of files older than some
arbitrary period (usually a few days or more). This procedure is
handled by <tt>root</tt> via <tt>cron</tt>. Some versions of Unix are
shipped with a <tt>root</tt> crontab to perform this cleanup, others
aren't.  Often the entry in crontab is draconian enough to remove
everything older than the required period - including directories,
named pipes, sockets etc.  Other entries will only remove files. In is
not unusual for system administration staff to add a similar entry to
<tt>root</tt>'s crontab if it doesn't already exist. <p>
 
So what this boils down to is that files in <tt>/tmp</tt> and
<tt>/usr/tmp</tt> (<tt>/var/tmp</tt>) are <b>TEMPORARY</b> and should
be treated as such. If you need to create a socket for mSQL you should
follow these simple rules: <p>
 
<ol>
    <li> If <tt>root</tt> is your mSQL master user, the socket should
    go in <tt>/dev</tt>. This happens by default under both mSQL version
    1.<i>x</i> and 2.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
    However some operating systems such as HP-UX 10.<i>x</i> ship with
    <tt>dr-xr-xr-x</tt> permissions on <tt>/dev</tt>. In this case,
    you should choose a different location entirely for the mSQL Unix
    domain socket. <tt>/var/msql</tt> is one possible choice. <p>
 
    For both mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> and 2.<i>x</i> this can be
    accomplished by editing: <p>
 
<pre>
    ./targets/<i>your-architecture</i>/site.h
</pre>
 
    and modifying the value of
 
<pre>
    #define MSQL_UNIX_ADDR  &quot;/dev/msql&quot;
</pre>
 
    for mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>, or
 
<pre>
    #define MSQL_UNIX_ADDR  &quot;/dev/msql2&quot;
</pre>
 
    for mSQL version 2.<i>x</i>. <p>
 
    Then re-compile. <p>
 
    <li> If <tt>root</tt> is not your mSQL master user, the socket
    should go in a directory that the mSQL master user can read/write
    but not one of the temporary directories <tt>/tmp</tt>,
    <tt>/usr/tmp</tt> or <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. <p>
 
    <ul>
 
	<li> For both mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> and 2.<i>x</i> this can
	be accomplished by editing
 
<pre>
    ./targets/<i>your-architecture</i>/site.h
</pre>
 
	and modifying the value of
 
<pre>
    #define MSQL_UNIX_ADDR  &quot;/tmp/msql.sock&quot;
</pre>
 
	Then re-compile. <p>
 
	<li> For mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> you can also start
	<tt>msqld</tt> with the environment variable
	<b>MSQL_UNIX_PORT</b> set to the new location of the mSQL
	socket. There is no need to recompile in this case. You will
	have to ensure that this environment variable is set for ALL
	programs that wish to communicate with <tt>msqld</tt> -
	including <tt>msql</tt>, <tt>msqladmin</tt>, <tt>relshow</tt>,
	<tt>MsqlPerl</tt>, etc etc. <p>
 
	<li> For mSQL 2.<i>x</i> you can also edit the mSQL config file
 
<pre>
    msql.conf
</pre>
 
	and change the value of
 
<pre>
    UNIX_PORT
</pre>
 
	By default this is <tt>%I/msql2.sock</tt> where <tt>%I</tt> is
	the directory in which you installed mSQL 2.<i>x</i>. There is
	no need to recompile in this case.
 
    </ul>
 
</ol>
<p>

<h3><a name="slow-connections">Why does it take such a long time to
connect to the mSQL database server?</a></h3>
 
Sometimes you may have difficulty in connecting to the mSQL database
server - <tt>msqld</tt>. <p>
 
<tt>msqld</tt> is a single threaded application and therefore can only
deal with one SQL query at a time. If <tt>msqld</tt> is busy servicing
an SQL query you may not be able to make another connection until the
SQL query has finished. mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> is extremely inefficient
in performing table joins. So an SQL query with only a single table
join may take many minutes to complete. <p>
 
There is no solution to this problem in mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>. The
only possible workaround is to ensure that your database schema is
designed in such a way as to avoid table joins at all costs. <p>
 
Table joins are much more efficient under mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> so
the problem will rarely be encountered. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="beta-expire">Why do I see <tt>&quot;This Beta test release
expires in 57 days&quot;</tt> when I start <tt>msql2d</tt>?</a></h3>
 
The current releases of mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> are beta versions. By
their very nature, beta versions are still in development. Hughes
Technologies has released the beta versions in an attempt to leverage
off the existing user base in order to do final testing and bug
fixing. <p>
 
The expiration messages are reminders to the users of the beta version
that Hughes Technologies expects to have either a new beta version or
a completed version released within the time limit suggested by the
message. <p>
 
If the time limit has elapsed, <tt>msql2d</tt> will cease to operate
and you will be presented with a message: <p>
 
<pre>
    This Beta test release has expired!
    Check out www.Hughes.com.au for a new release!
</pre>
 
This site has a few problems at present. Use
<a href="http://hughes.com.au">http://hughes.com.au</a>
instead. <p>
 
If a new version of mSQL 2.<i>x</i> (beta or otherwise) is not
available after the time limit has expired, it is a simple matter
to disable this feature using one of the patches listed below. Once
you have applied the patch you MUST recompile and re-install. There is
no need to recompile any third party applications as this patch only
affects the operations of the database server. <p>
 
To avoid conflicts with mismatched whitespace,
<a href="#how-to-patch">apply</a> the patch using the
&quot;<tt>-l</tt>&quot; option of <tt>patch</tt>.

<h3><a name="protocol-mismatch">What does the &quot;Protocol mismatch.
Server Version = 22 Client Version = 6&quot; error mean?</a></h3>
 
Messages similar to this mean that your client software is attempting
to connect to an mSQL database server which is running a different
version of the mSQL protocol. This could be a result of an old client
attempting to talk to a new server or a new client attempting to talk
to an old server. <p>
 
The numbers mentioned in the message give an indication of which
versions of mSQL each end of the session is using. In the example
given, the client was compiled with mSQL version 1.<i>x</i>
(specifically 1.0.16) because the protocol version is less than 10, and
the server is mSQL version 2.<i>x</i> because the protocol version is
greater than 20. <p>
 
This problem can be rectified by recompiling your third party mSQL code
(that is any client code that did NOT come with the mSQL distribution,
including software such as MsqlPerl etc) against the latest version of
mSQL available to you. <p>
 
Also see the section in the FAQ titled <a href="#recompile">&quot;I've
just installed the latest version of mSQL and now my own applications
won't work!&quot;</a>. <p>

field?</a></h3>
 
To handle a single quote, escape it with a backslash character. So the
string <p>
 
<pre>
    'Bambi's'
</pre>
 
would be entered as <p>
 
<pre>
    'Bambi\'s'.
</pre>
 
<b>Note:</b> This applies when using
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msql</tt></a> - the database monitor
program. If you're developing your own application you may have to
escape other characters that are special to the language you're using -
for example perl, C or tcl. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="escape-chars">What other characters need special
treatment?</a></h3>
 
When specifying table or field names or when inserting values into
fields, the only other character that requires special handling is the
mSQL escape character backslash. To handle a backslash, escape it with
another backslash. So the string <p>
 
<pre>
    c:\windows\system\
</pre>
 
would be entered as <p>
 
<pre>
    'c:\\windows\\system\\'
</pre>
 
When using regular expressions in queries of the form: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT table.column FROM table WHERE table.column LIKE 'regexp'
</pre>
 
the following rules apply: <p>

While we're on the topic of regular expressions, this explanation from
Robert Sum <a href="mailto:sumrn@ce-toolkit.crd.ge.com">
&lt;sumrn@ce-toolkit.crd.ge.com&gt;</a> may shed some light on what
happens inside mSQL: <p>
 
Robert writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    In mSQL 1.0.x, any time you use LIKE, you use an unusual form of
    &quot;regular expressions&quot; which are the way they are because of some
    historical implementation decisions that, in retrospect, were,
    perhaps, not the right ones. Consequently, mSQL 1.0.x does the
    following for a LIKE pattern which is somewhere between globbing
    and full regular expressions:
 
    1. it tries to force a match of the whole data string by implicitly
       prepending the pattern with the beginning-of-pattern operator ^
       and appending the end-of-pattern operator $ to the pattern
       (which makes the use/non-use of these operators a little quirky
       [see below]),
    2. it does NOT allow the ., *, and + regexps (they are plain characters),
    3. it does allow character classes using [] (i.e., any single
       character within the [] is matched unless the first char is ^ in
       which case any single character not in the [] is matched),
    4. it does allow alternation using |,
    5. it does allow grouping using (),
    6. it does allow optional characters or groups using ?,
    7. it allows _ to represent any single character (what would
       ordinarily be the . above),
    8. it allows % to represent any string of characters (what would
       ordinarily be the combination .*),
 
    As you can derive from above, the characters
 
	^, $, [, ], |, (, ), ?, _, %, \
 
    are all special in one way or another. There is a way to search for
    everything, it just might not be completely obvious. For instance,
    using the msql program, one can use
 
       \\_ to match _
       \\% to match %
       \\^ to match ^
       \\$ to match $
       \\\\ to match \
 
    Basically, there are three places where \ is used as the escape
    character:
 
      1. The msql program (always treats \ as an escape character),
      2. The translation process (treats \ as an escape only when
	 followed by % or _), and
      3. The regular expression evaluator (always treats \ as an escape
         character).
 
    In the first two examples above, steps 1 and 2 strip backslashes.
    In the next three examples, steps 1 and 3 strip backslashes.
    Things are actually a bit more consistent than folks realize, I
    think. (Note:  If you are using Perl or Tcl or some such, then
    replace 1. with appropriate activity of that application.)
 
    Furthermore, a recent message asked about
 
	SELECT * FROM doc_info
	WHERE foo LIKE 'x' or foo LIKE 'y' or foo LIKE 'z'
	and bar LIKE 'a' or bar LIKE 'b' or bar LIKE 'c'
 
    to which I replied, try
 
	SELECT * FROM doc_info
	WHERE foo LIKE '(x)|(y)|(z)'
	AND bar LIKE '(a)|(b)|(c)'
 
    Well, I forgot about rule number 1. above, which means this
    conversion may not be quite right and the original sender may need
    to fudge things a bit using either an additional set of parenthesis
    to force a match of the whole data string as in
 
	SELECT * FROM doc_info
	WHERE foo LIKE '((x)|(y)|(z))'
	AND bar LIKE '((a)|(b)|(c))'
 
    or if he really wants a match anywhere within the string
 
	SELECT * FROM doc_info
	WHERE foo LIKE '$|(x)|(y)|(z)|^'
	AND foo &lt;&gt; ''
	AND bar LIKE '$|(a)|(b)|(c)|^'
	AND bar &lt;&gt; ''
 
    then this should work, but as noted, one must be careful about the
    empty string. (If you want the empty string, just leave out the
    not equal clauses.)

<h3><a name="null-fields">How do I handle null fields?</a></h3>
 
For the NULL values, just use the NULL keyword. <p>
 
For example <p>
 
<pre>
    insert into foo values ( NULL, 1, 2, 'some text' )
</pre>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="no-case">How do I perform case insensitive
matches?</a></h3>
 
mSQL uses Henry Spencer's regular expression library with a few
modifications. To perform case insensitive searches, your query should
take the form <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_field LIKE '[Ss][Oo][Mm][Ee]
    [Vv][Aa][Ll][Uu][Ee]'
</pre>
 
Sol Katz's <a href="mailto:skatz@blm.gov">&lt;skatz@blm.gov&gt;</a>
<a href="#oo-html">Object Oriented HTML API</a> includes a C routine
that converts a string into its case insensitive form. You may wish to
use this in any C code that you write. See the section below on
<a href="#other-apps">&quot;Contributed Code and Third Party
Applications&quot;</a> <p>
 
Alternatively, you can create an additional field in each table that
will hold a single case version of the information you are likely to be
searching for. <p>
 
For perl users, Michael Cowden
<a href="mailto:cowden@leithaus.leitess.com">
&lt;cowden@leithaus.leitess.com&gt</a> has contributed this code
example: <p>
 
<pre>
    The following statement turns mSQL into [mM][sS][qQ][lL]
 
    $string = &quot;mSQL&quot;;
    $string =~ s/(.)/\[\L$1\E\U$1\E\]/g;
</pre>
 
Vivek Khera
<a href="mailto:khera@kci.kciLink.com">&lt;khera@kci.kciLink.com&gt;</a>
suggests a simpler method for perl users: <p>
 
<pre>
    Personally, I use this in Perl, as there is no need to complicate
    the regular expression with non-alpha characters.
 
       $string =~ s/([A-Za-z])/\[\L$1\U$1\]/gi;
</pre>
 
Rasmus Lerdorf's
<a href="mailto:rasmus@vex.net">&lt;rasmus@vex.net&gt;</a>
<a href="#php">Personal Home Page Construction Kit</a> includes built
in operations for case insensitive searches by way of its
<tt>msql_RegCase(string)</tt> command. <p>
 
Version 2 of mSQL will support functions similar to <tt>upper()</tt>
and <tt>lower()</tt> which will obviate the need for the above. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="add-column">How do I add a column to an existing
table?</a></h3>
 
You can't! Once a table is created it must stay the way it is. <p>
 
One possible solution is to use
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqldump</tt></a> to create an ASCII dump
of the entire database. Then edit this dump file by hand and add the
extra field to the CREATE clause. You'll also need to edit each INSERT
clause to ensure that the new field is referenced. Once you've
modified the dump file, drop and recreate the database using
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqladmin</tt></a> and re-populate the new
database using the dump file and
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msql</tt></a>. <p>
 
This procedure could be automated by a shell or perl script. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> Use the <tt>-c</tt> option to
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqldump</tt></a> to ensure that a
complete dump of the table is produced. <p>
 
As an example consider this output from
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqldump</tt></a>
 
<pre>
    #
    # mSQL Dump  (requires mSQL-1.0.6 or better)
    #
    # Host: localhost    Database: test
    #--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    #
    # Table structure for table 'test'
    #
    CREATE TABLE test (
      name CHAR(40),
      num INT
    ) \g
 
 
    #
    # Dumping data for table 'test'
    #
 
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('item 999',999)\g
    ...
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('item 0',0)\g
</pre>
 
If you wish to insert a field, say &quot;discount&quot;, then you will
need to modify the dump file as follows: <p>
 
<pre>
    #
    # mSQL Dump  (requires mSQL-1.0.6 or better)
    #
    # Host: localhost    Database: test
    #--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    #
    # Table structure for table 'test'
    #
    CREATE TABLE test (
      name CHAR(40),
      num INT,
      discount REAL
    ) \g
 
 
    #
    # Dumping data for table 'test'
    #
 
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('item 999',999,0.0)\g
    ...
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('item 0',0,0.0)\g
</pre>
 
<b>Notice</b> that every insert clause MUST be changed as well as the
table definition. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="parent-child">When should I call <tt>msqlConnect()</tt> in
a parent/child situation?</a></h3>
 
If both the parent and child processes want to talk to the mSQL server
then you must call <tt>msqlConnect()</tt> <b>AFTER</b> you fork. They
mustn't share the same socket. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="reserved-words">Can I use mSQL reserved words as field or
table names?</a></h3>
 
No. The mSQL parser gets very confused if you attempt to use reserved
words as the name of a table or field. The full list of reserved words
for both version 1.<i>x</i> and 2.<i>x</i> (as obtained from
<tt>msql_lex.c</tt>) is: <p>

<h3><a name="maxmin">How do I find the maximum or minimum value in a
table?</a></h3>
 
To obtain the maximum value use: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT number FROM table ORDER BY number DESC LIMIT 1
</pre>
 
To obtain the minimum value use: <p>
 
<pre>
    SELECT number FROM table ORDER BY number LIMIT 1
</pre>
 
This will only work with mSQL 1.0.9 and above unless you have applied
the unofficial LIMIT patch to earlier versions. See the
<a href="#list-archives">mSQL mailing list archives</a> for details on
this patch. (Before searching for this unofficial patch, you should
seriously consider upgrading to the
<a href="#current-version">latest</a> version of mSQL). <p>

    The LIMIT statement limits the number of records actually
    transferred from the server to the client. It doesn't limit the
    scope of the search at all in any way. That means that if you are
    looking for the maximum value in a table with 30,000 entries, the
    query will first build the entire sorted result in memory in the
    server, but when it comes time to transferring the result to the
    client, it only sends the first item.
 
    In many cases, especially when you have a lot of fields, or long
    fields, the time it takes to transfer the data from the server to
    the client is actually many times that of the actual search. And
    the msqld daemon is tied up and not available to other clients
    while it is wasting time sending result records that will never be
    used. So, if you do queries and you know you will only be looking
    at the first couple of them, you should use the limit clause and
    cut down on the amount of useless records being sent across the
    socket.

<h3><a name="reconnect">What happens when the mSQL server goes down
between requests?</a></h3>
 
If the mSQL database server process,
<a href="#support-progs"><tt>msqld</tt></a>, dies and is subsequently
restarted, or the host on which it was running is rebooted, any
processes that were connected to the mSQL database server MUST be
reconnected. This is not unique to mSQL, the Oracle database server
behaves in a similar manner. <p>
 
Programs that were connected to the mSQL database server should be
either restarted or have some internal mechanism whereby they notice
the server has died and attempt a reconnection. <p>
 
One possible method for checking the status of the database server
would be to examine the return status of the
<a href="#api"><tt>msqlSelectDB()</tt></a> call. <p>

<pre>
    I'm looking for a way to provide the full 25 connections to each of
    many mSQL databases running on a single box. Here's an idea, will
    it work? or is there a better way?
 
    (korn shell example)
    $ export MSQL_TCP_PORT=3000; msqld
    $ export MSQL_TCP_PORT=3001; msqld
    $ export MSQL_TCP_PORT=3002; msqld
 
    Then connect to the database as follows:
    $ export MSQL_TCP_PORT=3000; msql db_a
 
    While the above runs, another user connects:
    $ export MSQL_TCP_PORT=3001; msql db_b
</pre>
 
David Hughes replies: <p>
 
<pre>
    Well, sort of. By running 'msql db_a' you are using the local UNIX
    socket not the TCP socket so you'd have to use MSQL_UNIX_PORT not
    MSQL_TCP_PORT.
 
    The other thing is that you should run 3 MSQL_HOME areas
    (/usr/local/Minerva for example). If two of these servers __ever__
    access the same database at the same time then you are stuffed.
 
    So, something like
 
    export MSQL_UNIX_PORT=/dev/msql_1; export MSQL_HOME=/Minerva1; msqld&amp;
    export MSQL_UNIX_PORT=/dev/msql_2; export MSQL_HOME=/Minerva2; msqld&amp;
 
    and
 
    export MSQL_UNIX_PORT=/dev/msql_1; msql db_a
    export MSQL_UNIX_PORT=/dev/msql_2; msql db_b
 
    would do the job.

<h3><a name="unique-keys">How can I automatically ensure that each

mSQL version 1.<i>x</i> does not have an automatic key assignment
functionality. A number of solutions to this problem are available. <p>
 
<ul>
    <li> Use Pascal Forget's <a href="#sgs">unique sequence number
    generator</a>. <p>
 
    <li> Build the unique key assignment and management into your
    application. <p>
 
    One suggestion on how to implement this comes from Vivek Khera

    &lt;khera@kci.kciLink.com&gt;</a>. <p>
 
    Vivek writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    What I do is take some of the fields in the record, tack on a salt
    like the current time and generate a hash (either SHA or MD5) of
    it. I use part of the the hash string value as the key.
</pre>
 
    Another solution is provided by Rasmus Lerdorf
    <a href="mailto:rasmus@vex.net">&lt;rasmus@vex.net&gt;</a>. <p>
 
    Rasmus writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    The issue here is not so much how to generate a key, but how to
    ensure it is unique. The way I have done it in the past is to
    associate a lock file with each table. Each table has a counter
    record. With the table locked, I pull out the current counter
    value, increment it, and put it back. Then I unlock the table. This
    is not the most efficient way to do it, but it does work nicely for
    systems that do not get pounded with queries.
</pre>
 
    Others have suggested using a timestamp with milli second
    granularity. This approach has its pitfalls. <p>
 
    <ul>
	<li> Not all client side operating systems have access to the
	<tt>gettimeofday()</tt> calls (or its equivalent).
 
	<li> Not all systems can determine the system time to the milli
	second.
 
	<li> Because the timestamps are being determined by the
	clients, it is possible for two clients to arrive at the same
	timestamp. This problem is amplified if you have a number of
	clients running on different machines which are not
	synchronised. This can be avoided by recalculating the
	timestamp if an insert operation fails due to a duplicate key
	error.
 
	<li> Clocks may drift backwards causing old timestamps to be
	reused. Sites that use time synchronisation methods such as
	<tt>rdate</tt> or <tt>xntp</tt> may be prone to this.
    </ul>

    I have found a quick and dirty method that works for most
    situations. In my case, I include in the web form where I insert
    something into the database a HIDDEN field whose value is
    determined by a webpage hit counter. Any text-based server-side
    include hit counter is fine. For instance, in my page I have
    something like:
 
    &lt;input type=hidden name=id value=&quot;&lt;!--#exec cgi-bin/counter.pl&gt;&quot; &gt;
 
    the ID field is always different, although it may not be sequential.
    this didn't require a single line of code because I already had a
    hitcounter, and this is supposed to work for many situations.

<h2><a name="multiple-includes">How can I avoid compiler redefinition

and rerun the <tt>make install</tt> phase of the mSQL installation
procedure. This will remake all the core mSQL applications and install
the modified <tt>msql.h</tt> file in your installation <tt>include</tt>
directory. It will also reinstall the core mSQL applications in your
installation <tt>bin</tt> directory. There is NO need to recompile any
other third party applications. <p>
 
<hr>
 
<h3><a name="linking">How do I link the mSQL library with my own
code?</a></h3>
 
Most compilers will search a well defined list of standard directories
for include and library files. These are typically
<tt>/usr/include</tt>, <tt>/usr/lib</tt>, <tt>/lib</tt> and
occasionally <tt>/usr/local/include</tt> and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>.
If you wish to use files that are outside these locations you must tell
your compiler which directories to search. <p>
 
Most C compilers understand the command line arguments: <p>
 
<pre>
    -I<i>include_directory</i>
</pre>
 
and
 
<pre>
    -L<i>library_directory</i>
</pre>
 
to mean &quot;search the directory <i>include_directory</i> for
include files and search the directory <i>library_directory</i> for
libraries&quot;. <p>
 
If you wish to compile a program that will communicate with the mSQL
database server you must tell the compiler where the mSQL include and
library files were installed. Assuming you installed mSQL in
<tt>/usr/local/Minerva</tt> and you use <tt>gcc</tt>, the syntax would
resemble: <p>
 
<pre>
    gcc -c -I/usr/local/Minerva/include <i>your_prog.c</i>
    gcc -o <i>your_prog</i> <i>your_prog.o</i> -L/usr/local/Minerva -lmsql
</pre>
 
<b>Note:</b> Libraries <b>MUST</b> be specified last. Most compilers
will give strange errors if you specify the library paths and libraries
before any <tt>.c</tt> or <tt>.o</tt> files. <p>
 
<b>Note:</b> that the mSQL library name has been truncated. The actual
mSQL library file name is <tt>libmsql.a</tt>. However, the compiler
(and the link loader) only need the unique part of the file name so
the <tt>lib</tt> and <tt>.a</tt> components should be removed when
passing the library name on the command line. <p>
 
If you are using an SVR4 version of Unix (such as Solaris 2.<i>x</i>)
you may also have to include some networking libraries: <p>
 
<pre>
    gcc -o <i>your_prog</i> <i>your_prog.o</i> -lsocket -lnsl -L/usr/local/Minerva -lmsql

    <a href="mailto:bb@wizard.pn.com">&lt;bb@wizard.pn.com&gt;</a>
    has written some scripts that translate dBase III tables saved from

    Brian writes: <p>
 
<pre>
    Here are three scripts, the first two are clean ones that break out
    tables saved from access in dBaseIII format into a tab-separated
    format that a set of database-operator scripts called rdb can use.
    The first breaks out .dbf files and the second breaks out .dbt
    files which contain the text of variable-length-text memo fields;
    the .dbf and .dbt can be joined by the block offset number given in
    the text field. These scripts have only been tested on the field
    types my database happens to have. Since the first one breaks out
    the table definitions it's the obvious candidate to generate table
    definitions for msql. The third script is a hack to get data into
    msql so I can play with msql, but it's a starting point. The first
    two scripts were written to be free of data-dependent bugs, the
    third is somehow confused about null fields in Pascal's msql-import
    program which I've hacked around to enter the complaining fields as
    the text &quot;NULL&quot;; debugging is welcomed. The third script
    needs rdb, available from <a href="ftp://rand.org/pub/RDB-hobbs">rand.org:/pub/RDB-hobbs</a>. I do MS Access
    -&gt; rdb -&gt; msql because I use rdb as a prototyping tool, the
    format is trivial to generate and modify, I have a forms-based
    emacs front-end to rdb, and the tables compress nicely in rcs.
    However, someone may wish to modify these scripts, (a) so that they
    generate msql dump files instead of rdb files, thereby bypassing
    the msql-import bug and the rdb dependency and probably some data
    dependencies with maximum portability, or (b) so that they talk to
    the database directly. If so please post diffs. Trigger the new
    behaviour by a command-line option so the non-msql-perl behaviour
    continues to run under vanilla perl. These programs are gpl'ed.

    An Enterprise Object Framework (EOF) is an object framework that
    allows object oriented access to relational databases, where each
    row is considered an object. Besides a few limitations, it
    basically makes a relational database look like an OO database to
    the developer. By means of an adaptor, EOF can be used with
    virtually any database. The adaptor is responsible to transform the
    generic OO messages in database specific queries by subclassing a
    generic adaptor and modifying its behaviour. <p>

    To install the ODBC driver for the first time requires the use of an
    install disk.  This installs version 2.10.0.3 of the gorta drivers.
    Install from this and then overwrite the gorta dll (in the
    windows/system directory) with the one in the gorta 2.10.0.6 zip
    file.  The install disk installs both the 16 and 32 bit versions of

    The install disk tends to replace dlls with older versions.  This is
    a problem if you have ODBC already running.  Check the DLLs on the
