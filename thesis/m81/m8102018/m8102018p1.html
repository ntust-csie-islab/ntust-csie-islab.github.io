<a name="paper1"><h4>A Fuzzy Rule-based System for the Radical Extraction on Handwritten Chinese Characters</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this thesis, a fuzzy rule-based system for extracting radicals as the preclassification information for handwritten Chinese characters
vary a lot, we adopt fuzzy set theory to deal with the recognition of these fuzzy in nature patterns. Based on the structure of Chinese 
characters, the primitive but important features, i.e., strokes, are treated as fuzzy objects in the proposed system. That is, candidates
of strokes are provided to obtain more reliable and accures are used to combine the extracted strokes into compound strokes or radicals.
That is, the capability of the systems can be enhanced by increasing fuzzy rules appropriately. Thus, the proposed method is not only a 
reliable but also a flexible approach. Besides, since the number of rules of a fuzzy system is much less than that of a general rule-based 
system, e.g., in our system 60 rules are used to deal with 20 radicals, the computation effort is not heavy. Moreover, except the poor 
thinning results and mis-extracted characters, an average of 95% recognition rate on the radical recognition of 042 test characters, 
which are selected from the 100th samples of HCCRBASE(character image database provide by CCL, ITRI, Taiwan) is obtained. It not 
only confirms the feasibility of the proposed system. but also suggests that applying fuzzy set theory on HCCR is an efficient and 
promising approach.

<a name="paper2"><h4>Fuzzy Feature Extraction on Handwritten Chinese Characters</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this paper, a new feature extraction method based on the fuzzy set theory is proposed. Our feature extraction focuses on 
decomposing the structure of handwritten characters. Due to the Chinese characters are composed of strokes, features adopted 
here are all strokes. During extraction, extracted strokes are assigned various degree for each stroke type. Also, some flexible 
fuzzy rules are given to deal with stroke combination. Since the strokes of handwritten Chinese character are fuzzy in nature, our 
approach can obtain a better result on depressing the writing variants and distortions which are caused by thinning.  Moreover, 
current simulation results encouraged us to do further investigation.

<a name="paper3"><h4>A Fuzzy Rule-based System for Structure Decomposition on Handwritten Chinese Characters</h4></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
In this paper, a fuzzy rule-based system for decomposing the structure of divisible handwritten Chinese characters is proposed. The 
decomposition is aimed at obtaining a radical that can be used as the preclassification information for handwritten Chinese character
recognition (HCCR). Since the writings of handwritten Chinese characters vary a lot, we adopt fuzzy set theory to deal with the 
recognition of these fuzzy in nature patterns. Fuzzy rules which represent the character structures are used to combine the extracted 
strokes into compound strokes or radicals. The capability of the system can be enhanced by increasing fuzzy rules appropriately. 
Besides, since the number of rules of a fuzzy system is much less than that of rules of a fuzzy system is much less than that of a 
general rule-based system, the computation effort is not heavy. Moreover, except the poor thinning results and mis-extracted characters,
an average of 95% recognition rate on the radical recognition of 542 test characters which are selected from the 100th samples of 
HCCRBASE (character image database provide by CCL, ITRI, Taiwan) is obtained. It not only confirms the feasibility of the proposed 
system, but also suggests that applying fuzzy set theory on HCCR is an efficient and promising approach.
