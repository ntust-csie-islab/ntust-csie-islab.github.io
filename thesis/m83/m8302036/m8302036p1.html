<h4>Abstract</h4>
<blockquote>
  This research is based on a fuzzy neural network, named Knowledge-
Based Neural Network with Trapezoidal Fuzzy Set inputs(KBNN/TFS). We
use this network model to refine fuzzy rules by training data base. we
propose Interactive Consistency checking Engine with automatic Rule
Insertion and Deletion (ICE/RID) to perform fuzzy rule verfication. this
process is used to verify the initial rule base and the rule refines by
KBNN/TFS. With the interactive interface of ICE, we can detect redundant 
rules, subsumed rules, and conflict rules. Besides, we can also use RID to
insert and delete fuzzy rules automatically if necessary. The proposed model
is tested with Inverted Pendulum System(IPS) and a Knowledge Base 
Evaluator (KBE). In these experiments, we demonstrate the ability of
ICE/RID to remove inconsistencies and insert rules in KBNN/TFS. With the
combination of ICE/RID and KBNN/TFS, a valid and consistent rules base can
be obtained.
